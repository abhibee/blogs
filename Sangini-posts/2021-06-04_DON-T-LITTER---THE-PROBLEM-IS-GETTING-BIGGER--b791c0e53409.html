Littering is when garbage is not put in the dust bin and it’s thrown on the road which makes the place dirty. Littering causes a lot of garbage to collect up and this may affect hygiene and many people may fall sick. For some people, littering has become a habit and they throw garbage on the road even when there is a dustbin around.</p><p name="2641" id="2641" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In India, littering has become common and some of the streets have become very dirty. Educated people also throw garbage on the road and also, a lot of people are uneducated. Once, I was in a park and a boy threw a Coca-Cola bottle on the grass and went. I really did not like it and I threw it in the dust bin. I feel we should not litter and save the environment.</p><p name="b874" id="b874" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are many organizations and methods to keep India clean. One method is plogging. Plogging is when people go jogging and collect trash and put it in a bag while jogging. Plogging started in Sweden, 2016. There is a plogger called Ripu Daman Belvi who is appointed the blogging ambassesor of India. Swatch Bharath is a movement started by a Prime Minister, to keep the country clean and help poor people maintain hygiene. The slogan of swatch Bharath is “One step towards cleanliness”. The ugly Indian is an organization that cleans the streets of India just to keep them clean and does not earn money for that. They clean the place they have chosen and paint the walls. Anyone who wants to join can help. There is also a clean India campaign that educates people about hygiene.</p><p name="e41e" id="e41e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To keep India clean, I will not litter and stop my family and friends from littering. I will donate to the movement that is working for the cause. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If you litter, you will feel bitter.</strong></p><figure name="416e" id="416e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*PNtp7H26osYFN_J4nwDPDA.png" data-width="768" data-height="544" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PNtp7H26osYFN_J4nwDPDA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
