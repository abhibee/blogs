Rome was very much like a modern city. It had paved roads and even sewers. Water was brought in from outside the city by aqueducts. The center of the city was the Forum where everyday activities like shopping, bathing, and praying. The temples were mostly dedicated to Roman gods like Jupiter and Venus.</p><p name="8d4b" id="8d4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gladiators were slaves that were very strong and fought each other or animals for the entertainment of others. A Gladiator could become free from slavery, but only if he fought nicely. Sometimes, he could even become a celebrity!</p><p name="d69b" id="d69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the most famous buildings of Rome is the Colosseum. The Colosseum was a huge arena in which public shows were performed which were called circuses. These shows included gladiator fights and animal fights. Spectators could exit through 80 arches exits in the side. Animals could be released through trapdoors. The ground itself was made of wooden planks covered in sand. The seats in the Colosseum were like the classes of Roman life:</p><figure name="3a9e" id="3a9e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VQNltpA1RLwQnCbJ_93SHA.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="716" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VQNltpA1RLwQnCbJ_93SHA.jpeg"></figure><p name="e2b7" id="e2b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So the higher classes sat at the front and some of the lower classes sat at the back. The slaves only attended to help their masters. The emperor sat with his guests in a box kind of thing.</p><p name="3d66" id="3d66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The roman army was properly training and well equipped with weapons.
