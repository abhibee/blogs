              today.” You had promised! “Of Course, Dear! We are going for camping” said Mother. When they reached the
              campsite, Trixie started setting the tent, Jack lit the campfire, Mother started cooking the food.
              Suddenly a panda appeared.</p>

              he said “My name is Hermister. I see that you are having a good time. May I join you?” At first, the
              children were very scared. They got surprised when their mother said “Of course. But there is a problem
              that there is no place in the tent. Hermister said “That’s ok. I will sleep outside. So, after dinner,
              they went to sleep. At midnight Hermister woke up by some strange sound. Before he could take a step, 6
              elephants and 12 zebras came running towards him.</p>

              too. The leader of the elephants whose name was Boom Boom said “You seem to be very good people. You must
              live with us in the jungle for some time.” Lizzie, the zebra said “Yes, you must live with us. We will
              give you rides on our backs. Now the children were very excited. They looked at their Mother and as soon
              as she said yes, they got the zebras’ backs. But just when they did, there was a big storm and all the
              zebras and elephants started running away from mother. Jack and Trixie did not know what to do so they
              just held on tight. After some time, the storm subside and the zebras stopped. But Jack and Trixie did not
              know where they were nor did the zebras. Meanwhile, mother was also very worried. She saw some zebra
              footprints on the dirt. So, she followed them. Jack and Trixie were also retracing their footprints. After
              some time they bumped into each other. They were very happy to see each other but they still did not know
              where they were. Suddenly Jack said, “We also forgot Hermister!” Where is Hermister? “It is fine’’ said
              Trixie. No! “We must find him, what if he needs us” said Jack and mother together. So, Boom Boom said, “So
              it is settled then we are going to find Hermister.” One of the zebras named Herbetninja said “You can ride
              on our backs” And all the other zebras shouted yes except Lizzie. She said “But we do not where to start.
              Immediately everyone fell silent until an elephant named Elfeet said “Let’s just follow the path until we
              find some clues. They started walking and riding. They kept going on until they reached the desert.</p>

              But on that tree, they saw a H carved on the trunk. Jack said “Look! This H may be carved by Hermister. We
              might be on the right track”. They decided to rest under it for a while. After some time everyone was
              asleep. After half-an-hour everyone was awake. Well everyone, except Herbetninja, who woke everyone with
              his snoring.</p>
            <p name="b309" id="b309" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lizzie woke Herbetninja up and scolded “You are
              sleeping soundly and woke us all up by snoring like a tractor” The next thing was gales of laughter. They
              continued their search. Suddenly high winds blew and there was a sandstorm! SANDSTORM! Shouted Trixie.</p>
            <p name="89de" id="89de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then everyone heard a voice.</p>

              meant “Help” in Mongolian, so he shouted Tuslaach! Tuslaach! Suddenly, they could see two small figures
              coming towards them. The figures were two small kids! There was a boy named Makido and a girl named Waana.

              everyone that they were in Mongolia. Mother told the new kids and their father that all the animals could
              talk and about their search on Hermister. The family agreed to help them. Everyone drank water and rested
              there for the night. The next morning, they loaded the supplies on the elephants, as Boom Boom said that
              they would be happy to carry it, so they started moving on. Soon they were in China. Lizzie said “How will
              we find Hermister here?” It is so crowded.</p>

              said “I did not see a talking panda, but I saw a panda come by with some hunters.” Mother said “Oh dear!
              Hermister is in trouble!”After a while they still could not find Hermister. They decided to move north.
              Soon they were in Russia. Makido said “I have heard that Russia is a big country. Waana said “Yeah. How
              will we ever find Hermister here?” Herbetninja said “Let’s look in the half of Russia.” Trixie said “But
              what if Hermister is in the other half?” Boom Boom said “Let’s split up into teams. If you can’t find
              Hermister, meet back at China. So, team no.1 was Lizzie and 7 other zebras, Elfeet, Jack, Trixie and
              mother and team no.2 was Boom Boom and 4 more elephants, Waana, Makido and their father, Herbetninja and 3
              zebras. Team no.1 went west and team no.2 went east. They also decided to meet back in China if they could

              Ocean. Waana said “How will we cross this huge ocean?” Makido said “We will have to build a boat!” So,
              they started building a boat. The elephants uprooted trees, the children chipped of tree bark to make
              oars, the zebras collected tree gum and the adults stitched leaves for the sail with the help of thin and
              sharp tree bark. They assembled the parts together and the boat was ready. They sailed across the Pacific
              Ocean with the elephants swimming beside the boat.</p>

              blasted. Mother said “This place is too dangerous to stay in.” Jack said “But we have to find Hermister.”
              Waana and Makido’s father said “I have heard about a scientist who lives in Peru. Let’s go to him he will
              know what to do.” Lizzie said “So what are you waiting for?! Get on to our backs and let’s go! “With great
              difficulty they crossed the eruption of volcanos. After sometime they reached the scientist’s lab. The
              scientist’s name was Micheal. This time, Waana and Makido told all about their journey.</p>

              are there. But watches are very sensitive so I will give you these small boxes with mini cushions.’’ They
              set off to a place where not many volcanos blasted. After reaching there, scientist Micheal told them to
              always keep their watches in the boxes when not in use. After scientist Micheal left they started deciding
              where to go. Waana and Makido ‘s father said “Let’s go to Antarctica.’’ Mother said “Good idea.” So,
              everyone told their watches to go take them to Antarctica.</p>

              too.” They started the search in Antarctica. Lizzie and Elfeet teamed-up. Suddenly Lizzie and Elfeet heard
              a loud noise from behind an iceberg. They rushed behind it and saw a small door. They went through it and
              found themselves in a room of ice. They slowly made their way through it. As they were walking they heard
              strange bang again. The bang came from the corner of the room where there was another room. They opened
              the door and shouted “HERMISTER!” Lizzie said “Hermister! We are so happy to see you!” Elfeet said “Now
              let’s go and tell everyone that we found Hermister.” So, they rushed out of the iceberg and told everyone
              that they found Hermister. Everyone gathered around Hermister. Suddenly, Herbetninja slipped and pushed
              everyone ! They all went slipping and sliding all over the place. Unfortunately, all their watches broke.
              Then Elfeet said “Look! My watch is working” Herbetninja suggested “Let Elfeet go and get the boat. Till
              then Hermister can tell us his story.” Everyone agreed and Elfeet disappeared. Hermister begun — “When the
              storm started, I ran deep into the forest. In the forest I found a big circle and I jumped into the
              circle. And I found myself with some hunters.</p>

              continued “” I was half conscious. When I regained consciousness, I was taken past some ocean which I
              guess was the Pacific Ocean. When we reached land, we went southwards. We again reached an ocean. This
              time I became sea-sick. When we stopped sailing we were at Antarctica and they left me inside the iceberg
              in which Lizzie and Elfeet found me in. Suddenly there was a quarrel about whose fault was it to leave
              Hermister alone but it fell silent because of a loud sound from the ocean. It was Elfeet and he had got
              the boat with him. They started sailing and the elephants swimming beside the boat. Soon they were in
              Argentina.</p>

              had to somehow manage to ride on the elephants’ backs. When they reached the forest they never forgot the
              humans who helped them find Hermister. As for Hermister, he was very grateful.</p>

              they narrated their trips.</p>
