            <p name="f47d" id="f47d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the peaceful city of Hoshiarpur, there lived
              a small girl called Aadhya who loved to go shopping with her mother. Another thing that she liked was
              music. But one day a few more people came into her house that did not even know what it was! But they were
              not normal people. Read ahead to know how they discovered this amazing sound called music!</p>
            <p name="2c8f" id="2c8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day, when Aadhya was in the market with her
              mother, they saw that there was a small music show near the market. So, after buying the groceries they
              went to watch it as there was not a big crowd. But when they went home, they did not know that a few
              people from the festival who were also in chanted by the music had come with them. Not on purpose though!
              They seemed to think that Aadhya and she bought them. Yes! Not ‘brought’ but bought! This was because as
              soon as Aadhya and her mother left the room for lunch, the vegetables and fruits they had bought had come
              alive!</p>

            <p name="ecbf" id="ecbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The coriander said “Oh that lady had to
              pick me up just when I finished reading that book! “But the bookstand was so far away!” exclaimed onion
              “How does that matter!” scoffed coriander “After all, I am a green vegetable!” “Does it mean you have
              enmity with red! ”joined in tomato. She and the Coriander were always fighting on their colour. “Red
              symbolizes energy, love, and passion! I’d like to see what good green is! ” “Green symbolizes wealth,
              nature, and harmony. There you go! Now can you see that green is better!? By the way, did you know that re
              also shows danger!” shot back green.</p>

            <p name="31b0" id="31b0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--figure">“Oh keep quiet
              both of you! Don’t you remember that amazing sound we hired at the music festival Aadhya went to!”
              interrupted the bottle gourd “I really want to hear it again! Let me see, is it like this — La La La La LA
              LA LA “Oh stop that awful noise!” screamed carrot. “Oh! Wasn’t I good?” said Bottle Gourd, sad. “Defiantly
              not!” said tomato, rudely. “Let’s not be rude tomato! Well, bottle gourd, you may need some practice!”
              said carrot, calming down. “But that sound we heard at the festival was really nice, don’t you agree!?”
              “Yes,” said cauliflower, who was only listening intently till now. “I think I know what it is called. My
              brother had told me. It was something like ‘Music’.” Everyone was curious at this new word. “M-U-S-I-C”
              repeated onion slowly. “It is an interesting word. Even I know of a word that is related to this thing
              called ‘music’.” Everyone said intently “What is it!” So onion continued “I had a friend in the grocery
              shop. She said that once she had seen a music festival and there she had heard the humans call the thing
              that man had been blowing into an ‘instrument’!” “Do you mean that long thing that was making that
              whistle! I thought it was a magic whistler” said tomato. “Wait! Mabey it is used for magic! Mabey the
              humans do what he wants when he blows the ‘instrument’!” said Coriander, who was still angry so he was
              staying silent but when he got the idea he thought he had to tell everyone.</p>
            <figure name="32c7" id="32c7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image"
                data-image-id="1*GZfX8VqKlsFRxc1_9nO0Rg.png" data-width="720" data-height="684" data-is-featured="true"
                src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GZfX8VqKlsFRxc1_9nO0Rg.png"></figure>
            <p name="efe7" id="efe7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And that was useful! All the vegetables got
              excited and started wishing they also had a flute like that. Then cauliflower, who usually stayed silent,
              spoke. She said, “Mabey if we go one side of bottle gourd and blew and bottle gourd whistled, we could
              attract and then become friends with the humans!.” This seemed like a good idea to everyone because they
              all always wanted to be friends with humans. “So,” said carrot “would you like to be an instrument or not?
              It is ok if you don’t!” “No, it’s ok. I do want to be an instrument.” So all the vegetables except bottle
              gourd gathered near his head and blew. And when they blew, bottle gourd whistled. And then they knew that
              bottle gourd’s singing may not be very melodious but his whistling was very cheerful and happy. Hearing
              this sound Aadhya came running into the room and was very very very surprised to see all the vegetables
              she had bought with her mother were standing in a crowd over the head of the bottle gourd, blowing, and
              the bottle gourd was whistling?!</p>
            <figure name="3f38" id="3f38" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image"
                data-image-id="1*WcWIv5njhxqFeaTxgUlU5w.png" data-width="840" data-height="840"
                src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WcWIv5njhxqFeaTxgUlU5w.png"></figure>
            <p name="a722" id="a722" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">And then she laughed and laughed because it
              did make a funny sight. But the vegetables did not understand it. Carrot shouted “Hello human! Did you
              like our music?” Aadhya was even more surprised to see that the vegetables were talking to her. She
              replied “Hello! My name is Aadhya. Err…Were you trying to play the flute?” “What is a ‘flute’?” said
              Carrot “We are going to play this thing called an instrument. Have you heard of it?” “Yes,” Aadhya
              replied. “But and an instrument is not 1 thing. There are different kinds of instruments. I think a guitar
              would suit you. ” “What is a guitar,” said carrot. “Wait. I’ll make one and show you.” And she made a
              small guitar and gave it to carrot. Carrot took it and the small pair of sunglasses Aadhya had made of
              her.</p>

            <p name="3e47" id="3e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Aadhya said he looked nice
              and made some instruments for the other vegetables and started a small band. She invited her friends and
              each of them marveled at the vegetables. The vegetables were very happy and became very good with Aadhya.
