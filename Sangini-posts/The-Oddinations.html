Crazy said “You are stupid. Is it because your name is Dumbo? Never mind. Summer is fun. We can jump into the swimming pool from the eighth floor!” “That is crazy!” Silly said “Anyway, it is supposed to be as your name is Crazy! We can eat our ice cream in the pool! Now that is fun!” Dumbo said “No it is not! That is silly!” Arguing like this, the three friends were walking down the road on the first day of their summer vacation. “How many marks did you get in your exam?” asked Dumbo. “I got a hundred marks” Silly replied. Dumbo was surprised and said, “But I heard you got only one mark!”. Silly said “But I got a hundred marks!” Dumbo retorted “Don’t you know zero has no value! 1, 10, or 100, it does not matter!” Before Silly could reply, Crazy said, helpfully “Maybe the zeros jumped out of the page!” Then Dumbo interrupted “Oh enough about zeros! I have an idea! Let’s make a club that helps people!” “OK! At least you have a decent idea for once!” Said Dumbo and Crazy. Then Dumbo continued “Let’s call it the oddinators because don’t you think we are a little… Odd?” “YES!” shouted all of them. They all try to help but in their own silly ways. Crazy fed dog food to a cat to see what would happen and Dumbo spilled garbage all over the place while taking it to the bin whereas Silly, when he had to clean a pool, he swam in it instead. I hope the oddinators do not come to my house! Do you?</p><figure name="ee62" id="ee62" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Klab_RNrsXKf0x4D0Nqq3g.png" data-width="370" data-height="166" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Klab_RNrsXKf0x4D0Nqq3g.png"></figure></div></div></section>
