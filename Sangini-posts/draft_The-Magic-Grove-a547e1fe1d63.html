It was very hot. She lived with only her father because she had no mother and she had to take care of all the household work. She had asked her father to marry again he thought it was a good idea and he brought Vidyutprabha a step-mother. But her step-mother was lazy and made Vidyutprabha do all the work. And now that the step-mother had a daughter, Vidyutprabha’s work had doubled. </p></div></div></section>
