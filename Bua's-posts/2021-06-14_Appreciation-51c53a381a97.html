I think no. All of us need appreciation for the good work we have done, or which we think is a good work done. A little kid tries to behave properly just for a pat on his back to an employee doing his work diligently in expectation of appreciation by his co workers. A home maker is working non stop for the betterment of the family, the only compensation she expects is appreciation and respect.</p><p name="a568" id="a568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s such a small thing which is free of cost but gives immense satisfaction to the recipient. Then why not be generous enough to make someone’s day. If someone who is expecting appreciation does not get it then it breaks their hearts. Appreciation is like a fuel which keeps a person going. It can do wonders to someone. When a kid is appreciated by their parents while growing up they become more confident as they grow and they also learn to appreciate without any inhibitions.</p><p name="f768" id="f768" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I read a quote once that said, “A person who feels appreciated will always do more than what is expected.” I’m not sure who said it, but I know this is true because of how I feel when someone shows appreciation to me. It’s one of the easiest equations and it never fails: when we show appreciation to another person that person is more likely to help again, they are going to feel great, and they are going to try to exceed your expectations. Just a small thank you can do wonders. Sometimes a small appreciation can help breaking ice between strangers.</p><p name="2fba" id="2fba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is not a right or a wrong way to show appreciation. It should be simple, genuine and heartfelt. Genuine appreciation is powerful. It’s effects are powerful. Sometimes just a few words can make someone’s efforts worthy.</p><figure name="6a09" id="6a09" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*d7VGubD9lu1OG9Owdui0zQ.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*d7VGubD9lu1OG9Owdui0zQ.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
