Since it‚Äôs an important milestone with regard to growing up to an age where life begins in a different way maybe because one has the skills, experiences, and means necessary for an enjoyable life. Every one generally celebrates the day¬†in¬†a¬†grand¬†way¬†. So my loving family also planned the special day in my life well in advance. The plan was to visit banglore where everyone will reach from different places in India and have a grand party and then leave for Ooty and enjoy a fun-filled vacation. All the tickets were booked,¬†everything¬†was¬†planned¬†in¬†great¬†detail. All of us were very excited but a minute microbe spoilt all the fun which awaited us. Yes the dreaded coronavirus arrived in India to cancel all the plans we made.</p><p name="4974" id="4974" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On top of it lockdown was imposed and so we were struck at home, no one would visit anyone. It meant no celebrations. But I tell you it was a day I will remember very fondly for my whole life and I owe this to my beautiful loving family.</p><p name="5c2e" id="5c2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the night of 16 th May, kids and Kartikeya engaged me in some movie which I don‚Äôt remember and decorated the living room with handmade decoration and balloons¬†. It began on midnight when I was surprised to see a beautiful cake they ordered for me. Then an even bigger surprise was when kartik, mann and jiya took everyone( mummy papa from jaipur,mummy papa from Hoshiarpur, bhaiya bhabhi from banglore,happy from Kolkata) on video call and it was an emotional moment for me. I did not know that they had been planning this for long. Bhabhi and kids planned a video message of all the family members and friends containing lovely heartfelt messages which they showed me at that time, it was such a beautiful gesture that I was overwhelmed‚ù§Ô∏è. My brother sang a heartfelt song for me that was the moment when I could not stop my tears.</p><figure name="c531" id="c531" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Gmff_9JRwn6owBcfdGJmjg.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="530" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Gmff_9JRwn6owBcfdGJmjg.jpeg"></figure><p name="90fa" id="90fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The 17 th morning I was very happy and thankful for such a beautiful surprise they all gave me, but it was just a beginning. As soon as I woke up I was given an envelope which contained an air ticket( not real)and a boarding pass( not real) which said I have to board a flight from Delhi to banglore. I was taken aback when they decorated a room as a plane and asked me to sit on a recliner and relax. Then they served me a welcome drink and the breakfast there. Kartik was doing all the cooking and kids were serving posing like the flight attendants üòÄ. It was so sweet and adorable. They also put an I pad for inflight entertainment and asked me to enjoy. Later they gave a blank paper and pen for writing the experience of the journey. I received calls from many people and I enjoyed talking to everyone sitting on the makeshift aeroplane they created for me. It was like a pretend play where they did not want me to get sad for not able to go for vacation by bringing the experience home. Then came the handmade gifts¬†. The beautiful cards be mann and jiya and a painting by mann and a handmade cushion by jiya.</p><figure name="d20a" id="d20a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4-anc6gHD24q23e12C4uig.jpeg" data-width="1776" data-height="1776" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4-anc6gHD24q23e12C4uig.jpeg"></figure><figure name="69f2" id="69f2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--figure"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*x_LoKG7mAEcfUMAAjzcrPw.jpeg" data-width="1776" data-height="1776" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*x_LoKG7mAEcfUMAAjzcrPw.jpeg"></figure><p name="bc85" id="bc85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For lunch my super chef Kartikeya made awesome food ending with yummy shahi tukda which was commendable on his part as it was a very hot day and spending so much time in kitchen just to make me feel special,was his way of showering love on me.</p><figure name="2536" id="2536" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ooplvLhvW8EPLvA52w9fig.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="960" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ooplvLhvW8EPLvA52w9fig.jpeg"></figure><p name="69b9" id="69b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">By evening when I thought that my beautiful day has ended well and With so much of attention been thrown I was contended, then bhabhi called to say that a zoom party is planned with the whole family. So it was not the end¬†. We had a fun-filled online party where everyone enjoyed and we even played games. Another cake which was home baked by jiya was cut and thus ended the super celebrations of the special day of my life.</p><figure name="9475" id="9475" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2w3EBVPlGsFi3uSM_laM-Q.jpeg" data-width="1776" data-height="1776" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2w3EBVPlGsFi3uSM_laM-Q.jpeg"></figure><p name="5e39" id="5e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I am so grateful to God for giving me such loving family. I pray to the almighty to protect the happiness, bonding and love between us always.</p><p name="5662" id="5662" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">That day reminds me how small gestures can make any moment a celebration. One does not need fancy parties or expensive gifts to be happy. Happiness is when one experience the love of those who are so special in one‚Äôs life. I am thankful to everyone who made the day super special for me. Lots of love and hugs to all of you.</p></div></div></section>
