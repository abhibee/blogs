Appropriate distance from the sun, the atmosphere and water has helped living beings thrive on Earth. But there is an abstract thing which is very important for the growth and existence of living beings that is compassion and empathy for fellow beings.</p><figure name="4d90" id="4d90" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*TqaHK7kuTB29u1UxfZVz9g.jpeg" data-width="720" data-height="490" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TqaHK7kuTB29u1UxfZVz9g.jpeg"></figure><p name="f1d7" id="f1d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Mankind is considered to be the most superior beings among all. There is this thing which is called humanity which makes a man human. Humanity helps a person distinguish between good or bad and choose right over wrong. Compassion makes human think about others loss before thinking about their own gains. If a person is compassionate he/ she will help anyone in distress and will never want to hurt any one willfully. Whenever our minds connect with our heart compassion is born. Few people are very compassionate and world is happy place because of people like them. Compassion is a way of life and the need of the hour. We have seen examples of how strangers have come forward and helped people in distress. Even there are numerous kind hearted people who not only help other people but also animals like stray dogs, cows ,birds etc. God bless such kind souls who are filled with compassion and their act also inspire others to follow suit.</p><figure name="e4d8" id="e4d8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oJOhAx-IRb8Ph8yxXOWFAg.jpeg" data-width="600" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oJOhAx-IRb8Ph8yxXOWFAg.jpeg"></figure><p name="abf9" id="abf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We often come across amazing stories from animal kingdom which fill our hearts with so many emotions. How animals can show compassion is just unbelievable. We have seen how even in some cases the predator animals adopt and take care of helpless. We have heard stories of how natural born enimies become friends. All these examples are so beautiful that make the animals equal to the humans or even better sometimes. There exists a heartwarming relationship between animals and humans too for ages. This shows that compassion is not limited to human hearts but also every other being living on this world.</p><figure name="9778" id="9778" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*igsxNVf6r9OiPqlQtIS6DQ.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*igsxNVf6r9OiPqlQtIS6DQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="d618" id="d618" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">We are just a small part of this universe and it is our task to widen our circle of compassion to include every other living beings be it a plant or an animal.</p></div></div></section>
