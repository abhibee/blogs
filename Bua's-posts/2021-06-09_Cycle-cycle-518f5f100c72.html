I am also very fond of cycling. So many memories I have with my cycle, it’s so nostalgic. I remember how I used to go and fro school or anywhere on my bike. How my whole evenings were spent cycling with my best friend. How my cousin used to double carry me on her cycle. How my son took over a month to learn cycle and I had to literally run with him( thanks to the Neighbors who never complained about the dents on their cars, or maybe they don’t know it was him). How my daughter one day at a very young age just started riding without support. How we still like to go on cycle rides together. But then I have many memories of falling from the cycle and getting terrible wounds too. And believe me they are very funny. Once while returning from school all friends decided to do some tricks on cycle . So we formed a chain by holding others handle by one hand, and that was a terrible mistake. We had a great fall followed by good scolding not to mention how badly we got hurt.</p><figure name="3615" id="3615" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XPKWkvfGZSfDd3Xw01OlYA.jpeg" data-width="480" data-height="360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XPKWkvfGZSfDd3Xw01OlYA.jpeg"></figure><p name="2ffd" id="2ffd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Here is another incident which happened when I was a novice at riding. My brother learnt to cycle at a very young age but whenever I wanted to learn he always denied saying I was too young for it. So one day I took the task of learning myself and learnt how to balance and ride quite fast, I was around 10 at that time. By now I knew how to ride bicycle but what I did not know was how to stop the cycle as I was very scared to apply the brakes from the fear of falling suddenly. I used to stop the cycle by slowing it down gradually with the help of my legs touching the ground, but never with brakes. I was a jumpy kid and used to get hurt all the time but even then I was very scared of falling from cycle.</p><p name="bd98" id="bd98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">After riding few times I got overconfident . One day while returning from school I was boasting in front of him that I can even defeat him in a cycle race. So for fun he started speeding up. He was by then a pro and I wasn’t but I wanted to show him my newly developed skills so I also started speeding up. We were riding at a good speed and were laughing non stop when suddenly there came a turn. My brother screamed at me to apply breaks but I never used them and till the time I understood it was too late. I crashed into the hedge with wire fencing of a neighbour’s house and I flew and fell in their garden. I was hurt with deep cuts in my leg. He came running and helped me return home. It took some days to heal and return back to my cycle again but then the first thing he did was to teach me how to apply breaks. I still remember how worried he got that day but few days later when I was again fit and fine he again started to tease me and annoy me on my cycle skills. But now we laugh at those funny little falls and enjoy the stories of the time spent together.</p></div></div></section>
