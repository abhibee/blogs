I always liked the examination days since I was in school and it continued till I completed my CA. In normal days I used to waste a lot of time thinking what to study how to study. What if I study one subject and forget the other. The exam days are less confusing. Everything was set. You only need to study that subject with set syllabus. You don’t need to think a lot. You have nothing else to do except studying.</p><p name="9317" id="9317" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This year because of surge in covid cases both the 10 th and 12 th board examination were cancelled. Many kids breathed a sigh of relief whereas many kids were disappointed. Those who are feeling disappointed they must know that it is just a beginning there is no dearth of examinations here. There are entrance tests, then college exams, professional exams and many more. You will get too many opportunities to appear in examinations. So you won’t miss giving examinations at all. And apart from this the life is full of tests where there is no set syllabus too. One must prepare to pass the test of time in life which is more important. Such small things like cancellation of board exams must not disappoint you if you are really a smart kid. One must prepare to face the ups and downs in life with patience and courage. Covid times is a testing time for the whole world, let’s hope and pray the mankind comes out of it victoriously.</p><p name="4105" id="4105" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Life will give many surprise tests, no one can escape that, and it is critical to come out of it with flying colours, that is the true success.</p><figure name="6cff" id="6cff" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HelWxk-5Y9EeNuoFq8Ik3w.jpeg" data-width="447" data-height="382" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HelWxk-5Y9EeNuoFq8Ik3w.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
