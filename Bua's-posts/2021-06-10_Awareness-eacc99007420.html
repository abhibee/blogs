It is very difficult for a common man to know and remember all the laws. That is why whenever there is some issue they go to legal advisors for the remedies. But to protect some basic rights, a common man should know about few of them. Today basic rights and duties are taught in schools and is generally known to all. But apart from that there are few basic laws which would be interesting to know.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="31bf" id="31bf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">A police officer is never off duty:-<br>The police have investigative powers that they can use at any time of day or night. This means that police officers can exercise their police powers while off duty, even when in plain clothes (not in uniform).Police officers in plain clothes are obliged to provide proof of their identity without having to be asked. If someone wearing ordinary clothing says that they are a police officer, they must show you their police identification card without being asked. Police officers in uniform only have to show proof of identity if you ask them to.</li><li name="d354" id="d354" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A pregnant women cannot be fired:- It has been observed that employers have adopted the process of dismissing the services of an expectant woman employee either prior to availing the maternity leave or during the leave- this is strictly prohibited under Section 12 of the maternity benefit Act. It clearly restricts the employer from dismissal of a woman during absence or pregnancy or to give notice of termination of her services during or on account of such absence.</li><li name="c538" id="c538" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">LPG customers can claim compensation in case of accidental cylinder explosion:-<br>Both, the LPG companies (oil companies) and the LPG Distributors (Gas agencies) take Third Party Liability Insurance. No premium is collected from the LPG customer. The LPG accident victims can claim insurance from the company and also from his/her local Gas Agency (distributor).</li><li name="a984" id="a984" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Shopkeepers cannot sell products beyond mrp:-<br>A retailer cannot sell any product above the printed MRP. It is the rule that a shopkeeper cannot sell above the MRP fixed by the manufacturer. Though a person can sell the product at a lesser price than that of the MRP or also known as the discounted price but cannot sell above it under normal circumstances. But On 12th December 2017, the Supreme Court of India on hearing the petition by the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Associations of India (FHRAI) ruled that the hotels and the restaurants can sell the products above the MRP. The reasoning given by the court is that the restaurant and the hotels are not making a simple sale like any retailer, they are providing extra services for their customers like the ambience and cutlery etc. the court has directed that the Legal Metrology Act, would not be applicable upon them and they would not be prosecuted for selling products at a higher price than the MRP.</li><li name="c4d9" id="c4d9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">No hotels can deny anyone to provide potable water to drink or to use its washrooms under Indian Sarais Act, 1887, Even if it’s a 5-star hotel.</li><li name="9de5" id="9de5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Automotive (Modification) Invoice, 2016:- In case you are fined for against the law (like driving with no helmet or some other cause) then you’ll not be fined for a same offence on the same day.</li><li name="bb4c" id="bb4c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Indian Penal Code, 166 A:- A Police officer can’t refuse to lodge an FIR if he/she does then they may be jailed for as much as 6 months to 1 yr.</li></ol></div></div></section>
