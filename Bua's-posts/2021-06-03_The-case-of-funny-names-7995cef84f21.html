But even serious matters can turn hilarious when the names of the cases are comical.Lets see few cases with funny names and laugh out loud<br><br>&#39;<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Terrible v. Terrible.&#39;</strong></p><p name="f927" id="f927" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nevada couple Joseph and Elizabeth Terrible wanted a divorce. What may be the reason but it was terrible😁. Funny court cases like this couldn’t have a more terrible name.</p><p name="4cb3" id="4cb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The parties got divorced in 1971. A year later, somebody offered to buy the Terrible property, and Mr. Terrible wanted to accept. The former Mrs. Terrible did not, and Mr. Terrible filed this case (hereinafter “Terrible II“) to “partition his interest.” Ordinarily, a tenant in common has every right to do that, but here Mr. Terrible was screwed because, the court held, he had waived this right by agreeing to let Mrs. Terrible stay put.</p><p name="6f12" id="6f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Batman v. Commissioner🦇</strong><br><br>No it’s not the BATMAN who is involved in the case but Texas farmer named Ray Batman seriously wanted to convert his farm into a family partnership by transferring some assets to his teenage son. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue said no, but Ray wasn’t getting the Bat signal and brought it up with the Court of Appeals. No luck for Batman.<br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Death v. Graves🎃</strong></p><p name="8ba4" id="8ba4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alan and Demetri Death sued Graves &amp; Co.😀 for crashing their vehicle into the Death family motorcycle. Fortunately, Death lived. These are the things TV crime dramas always get wrong.</p><p name="d597" id="d597" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey🥃</strong><br><br>The first thought that comes to mind is how whiskey got involved in the case, was he drunk😀. This 1876 case was brought against a man alleged to be transporting whiskey across county lines with the intent to sell to a tribe of Chippewa Indians which was regarded as a violation of trade and treaty laws at that time.</p><p name="f64b" id="f64b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">South Dakota v. Fifteen Impounded Cats</strong><br><br>We all know cats are very clever, but they will land in some court case ,never imagined.<br>A woman nearly backed into a cop car because her rear window was obstructed by her 15 cats traveling with her in her car 🐱🐱. Cops seized the cats, and the woman appealed to the state Supreme Court to get them back. The Court found the cat seizure justified for the safety risk they posed to other drivers.<br><br><br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola</strong><br><br>Funny court cases should always involve soda. This was a federal suit in which the government tried to get Coca-Cola to remove caffeine from its product. One sip will tell you how that ended.</p><p name="df5d" id="df5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Robin Hood v. United States</strong></p><p name="68f6" id="68f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Robin Hood was involved in the case but he is not the same World famous Robin Hood.🙄<br>A plaintiff who called himself Robin Hood filed a complaint against the United States Government alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (a.k.a. the RICO act, often used to bust organized crime leaders) on behalf of any citizens who had been “robbed by banks, attorneys, and the government they tried to support.” His case was dismissed. So someone was trying to be Robin Hood huh.</p><p name="3ed9" id="3ed9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Courtesy:-https://www.rd.com/list/funny-court-case-names/</p></div></div></section>
