He used to hit gym everyday and people around were really impressed by his commitment and hard work. But that was the only hardwork he did in the whole day, as soon as he returned home he used to hit bed. He demanded that the breakfast and milk was also to be served to him on the bed because he was too tired to sit. Everybody at home was tired of seeing him tired. His mother used to scold him for not being active but he never listened, he believed that he has done his bit of hardwork for the day in gym itself. Once his father also offered to help him open a gym and be an instructor there as it was his passion and being broad minded he always told him to make his passion his work. But oh no!! He was not at all ready for that. So at last they had all given up to his routine and never bothered him for work, though they were worried about him.</p><figure name="72fa" id="72fa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*fLaLF9dwTOIK-SqHxtkgKw.jpeg" data-width="500" data-height="443" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fLaLF9dwTOIK-SqHxtkgKw.jpeg"></figure><p name="b255" id="b255" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This day was different. When he came back from his regular tiring work (out) of the day he saw his mother fuming. Though he never bothered about what is happening around at home but today for a change he asked his mom what is the issue. His mother told him how the house help has not turned up and on top of it her uncle called up telling that he and his family are reaching there in 2 hours. Had there been any prior notice she would have prepared in advance but now she is not sure how she will handle alone. The milkman also did not deliver milk and few other stuff were finished at home. Then she turned to him with expectation. He understood the look in her eyes and tried to escape. But his mother was not in a mood to excuse him. So with a long list he was asked to go to the market and buy the stuff.</p><p name="efa2" id="efa2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He looked for the car keys ( obviously he is too tired to walk to the market which was just a kilometre or 2 away but to him it was too far), but could not find them. His mother told him that his father has taken the car to office. He was too disappointed but mother was not ready to hear any thingÂ . So he decided to take the scooterÂ . The catch here is he never bothered to learn how to ride a scooter in his busy life till now. But he always thought it was not a big deal. But what followed was not what he expected. First he struggled to remove the stand of the scooter. Two girls ( who also used to gym at the same time as him) offered help to him but he politely refused. Then he kicked on the pedal many times but the scooter was not ready to start, â€˜Oh God why the scooter was behaving like this in front of everyoneâ€™ he thought. A teenager boy came and in just one stroke started the scooter.</p><p name="c8c5" id="c8c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He sat on the scooter and put on gear and oh it was so easy to ride the damn scooter. All was going well till there was a turn on the road. He could not turn the scooter and skid and fell. Till then all the people who admired him gathered to see him ride the scooter as it was a rare sight. But when he fell from the scooter and the way he was riding, they could not control their laughter. He got some minor scratches and a sprain in his legÂ , the snail speed of the scooter saved him from anything major physically. But mentally something major happened. It was so embarassing for him that he gave up his sedentary life and not only learnt how to ride the scooter he also opened a gym of his own and helped everyone get healthy and active.</p><figure name="8c42" id="8c42" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qr025myOrgSjCctq0JIX4w.jpeg" data-width="800" data-height="681" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qr025myOrgSjCctq0JIX4w.jpeg"></figure><p name="ce73" id="ce73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Sometimes a particular incident can change things for good.</p></div></div></section>
