He used to work hard and lived his life with whatever he earned by selling his crops. His earnings were enough to sustain his family of six . He was happy and content and never wanted more. Every morning he left home early to sow the seeds or to water the crops and used to return by lunch time, then he used to be with family and the evening time was adda time when all the men from the village used to sit together and exchanged wisdom and hookah. Only during the harvest season he used to spend more time with his crops than at home.</p><figure name="cfa7" id="cfa7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6_L2xWM_iuFTL8sI1NIiQw.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="667" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6_L2xWM_iuFTL8sI1NIiQw.jpeg"></figure><p name="905d" id="905d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">One evening during the assembly he got to know how the government is planning to lay a railway track and a station near their village. Everyone was so excited that they partied all night. The next day the notification came about the same but there was a catch which nobody had thought about earlier. The railways planned to take over the farm lands which came under the proposed route of the new tracks. Sukhbir Singh’s land came under its ambit. He was told that he will be compensated well by the railways and he can then buy another land and live his life as usual. Being a law abiding citizen and happy about the progress of his village he agreed to give his 2 acres of land for the noble cause.</p><figure name="6fab" id="6fab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uNHdDVpWprCaRtWG2EwRsA.jpeg" data-width="960" data-height="639" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uNHdDVpWprCaRtWG2EwRsA.jpeg"></figure><p name="8d0b" id="8d0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The cost of his land was around 60–70 lakhs per acre, so he expected that with around 1.2 crores he will get a similar land nearby and it won’t be a problem. But to his astonishment the railways fixed the rate for his land at 25 lakh per acre. Now he was worried. He discussed with his friends in village who asked him to meet a lawyer. They assured him that only judiciary can help him in the issues with the government. The son of the sarpanch of the village was a lawyer so he rushed to him for help.</p><figure name="e5bc" id="e5bc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VFhMDIfCDCIUOOplWnWDDA.jpeg" data-width="3800" data-height="3428" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VFhMDIfCDCIUOOplWnWDDA.jpeg"></figure><p name="85b7" id="85b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Guninder, the son of the sarpanch heard everything which Sukhbir told him patiently and filed a case in the court of law on his behalf. The court heard his arguments and all the evidence of the price being too low was also produced in the court. The court held that the compensation being given to him was too low and increased the compensation to 50 lakhs per acre taking overall compensation to 1 crore.</p><p name="9dc4" id="9dc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this was not the end of the story. The railways defied the order of the court and paid only 40 lakhs to Sukhbir. Sukhbir was not ready to give up. He again moved to court .</p><figure name="2990" id="2990" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*QoaOd7006Ox7aDzsg9EMsg.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="800" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QoaOd7006Ox7aDzsg9EMsg.jpeg"></figure><p name="aee5" id="aee5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This time the court gave such an unprecedented order which was never been heard in the history. The court attached the Shatabdi train standing at the Jalandhar station, technically giving it to the aggrieved farmer and thus making him the owner of the train, as the railways failed to comply with the court’s order . Sukhbir Singh was overjoyed as in his wildest dreams he could not imagine that he will be the owner of the Shatabdi express ever. Not only Sukhbir no one can ever think of owning a train. The railways had to pay the total compensation and wean off the train from the poor farmer.</p><p name="716d" id="716d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the power of the judiciary in our country.</p><figure name="50a2" id="50a2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*RP23jwPySbOX2410wxK3vA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="795" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RP23jwPySbOX2410wxK3vA.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
