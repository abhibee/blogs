Since I was younger child, my parents and my brother who was just 2 years elder always regarded me as too naive and laughed at whatever I said, they thought it was too comical. But obviously like all the kids I always thought that my wisdom was more than or at least at par with everyone and it used to irk me when they just dismissed everything I said.</p><p name="a8c4" id="a8c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I vaguely remember the year but surely remember the incident. I was a little girl in an impressionable age. Whatever was taught in school used to stay in my mind for long. So we had life sciences class in school where we were first time introduced to the chapter on micro organisms. The teacher explained to us how there are germs everywhere and in everything. But there was a different kind of understanding that was going on in my little brain and it registered that there is some dangerous invisible objects which is everywhere and in everything.</p><figure name="cf26" id="cf26" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DEkBApByvUtmVD_59ftddA.jpeg" data-width="800" data-height="620" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DEkBApByvUtmVD_59ftddA.jpeg"></figure><p name="4ce8" id="4ce8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So that night when all of us were sitting on the dining table I refused to drink waterÂ , and call it young Sheldon effect or whatever( though there was no Sheldon at that time)Â ,I could actually see germs in the waterðŸ˜‚. When my mom asked why I am not drinking water through out the day, I told her what I see and as expected everyone bursted into laughter. I was amazed to see their reaction. I obviously thought they are not aware of what I was taught in school or may be this is something which is new and they have not read about itðŸ™„. Since there was no Google at that time, the only Google which we were familiar with were the parents and if they are not aware of anything then the only way left was to seek information from the books. So I told them how there are germs in everything everywhere and how dangerous thay are, to my surprise they again started laughing. I wanted them to be aware of it but they were again not ready to learn. The only way left was to show them the textbook where it was clearly mentioned that there are germs everywhere. So I rushed to get my textbook and showed it to my mother. I was bewildered to see them laughing continuously. It was this moment when I started cryingÂ . I knew that they all never liked me crying and that was the only way I could stop their laughter. My mother explained to me that itâ€™s ok that there are germs every where but since they are not visible to naked eyesÂ , you need microscopes to see them, they were laughing because I could see them like that only.</p><p name="78d3" id="78d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Till now many times my mom remember this and whenever I tell her something she always laughs and ask me to bring book and show it to her where it is written. But now I also laugh at all those puerile things I said or did. I also laugh with them now, it does not irk me anymore.</p></div></div></section>
