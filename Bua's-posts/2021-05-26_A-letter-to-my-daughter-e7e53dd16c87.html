I prayed for 9 months everyday when I was expecting you for a daughter like you.When I held you in my arms for the first time I felt that my prayers got answered and my heart was filled so many emotions that I cried and smiled simultaneously. You were the cutest baby I have ever seen. Though you will always be my baby but as you are a teenager now in my opinion you are still the most beautiful girl in the whole world. When I say beautiful it not only about how you look but also you have the most beautiful heart in the whole world.</p><p name="44ef" id="44ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You make me proud in so many ways. I thank God for choosing me as your mother. Your athletic abilities are something which is God gifted and I am so happy that whatever game or sport you play you give your heart and soul to it. Whenever you win my heart fills with pride and whenever you loose you must know that I am always on your side. It’s okay to be sad and disappointed for some time but then you should reflect and find out what went wrong and work on it. Just know that I will always by your side. Whenever your teachers praise you and they do it very often I feel elated and feel on top of the World.</p><figure name="ee50" id="ee50" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pm7pqJqjPZLMFbOjgJUEuw.png" data-width="500" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pm7pqJqjPZLMFbOjgJUEuw.png"></figure><p name="5034" id="5034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I want you to know what your treasures are my baby. You have a very kind and loving heart, it doesn’t matter anyone understand you or not, you must not loose your kindness and love. You are benevolent and I like that you are always eager to help anyone who is in need. You are strong, determined and energetic. It’s very good that you take stand against anything you feel is wrong. You are multi-talented and to hone your talents you must be eager to learn. You must know that I am there to support you in this process whatever way possible. You are a quick learner. I want you to use the gifts given to you wisely. Remember I always want you to win in whatever you do but winning hearts is most important than anything. Patience is virtue and you will achieve impossible things with patience.</p><figure name="e763" id="e763" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BBSvQamvvb-96cmSpyqy0w.jpeg" data-width="826" data-height="968" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BBSvQamvvb-96cmSpyqy0w.jpeg"></figure><p name="b0ae" id="b0ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I know how much you love me and the way you show it is too sweet. I like to cuddle you hug you. Sometimes I like to annoy you too because I like the your childlike reaction. The way you and your brother make the special days like birthdays more special is also gratifying. You bake excellent cakes. I remember on your father’s Birthday you wanted to make a piniata cake and I was not sure you can make it, but I am so happy that you proved me wrong by making such a beautiful cake.</p><p name="ad69" id="ad69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end I want to tell you that you are the best daughter in this world and always be the sweet little girl to me. I see my own reflection in you and I trust you beyond and believe in you and will always be with you.</p><figure name="2032" id="2032" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Em2_BFO5aQp9IdoNk6dzyg.jpeg" data-width="450" data-height="400" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Em2_BFO5aQp9IdoNk6dzyg.jpeg"></figure><p name="dabe" id="dabe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">(All the) love (in this universe)<br>Your mummy</p></div></div></section>
