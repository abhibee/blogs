When all of us want to be positive but dont want anyone to be positive. What an irony. But one can be and should be positive even if he or she is positive. But amidst such negativity what is it that can help us stay positive.</p><p name="bd9d" id="bd9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today I want to see the scenario from a different perspective. I am thankful that the pandemic came in today’s time and not earlier. You must be thinking how can someone be thankful about this. No I am not thankful for the pandemic,its a difficult time for the whole world I agree but I am saying that I am thankful that the it came in today’s time and not earlier. Just think how much easier it is to stay at home for general public when few of the people can be out there helping with home deliveries of everything one can think of but if it came earlier how anyone could have managed. It was different then, one had to step out of home for everything and anything. So I am grateful for the development of electronic shopping sites. It was just waiting to be accepted and the pandemic made the process super fast and now the vegetable vendors are also tech savvy when the delivery and payment is concerned. I am thankful to the e-payment sites for the ease it provides to make payment for the smallest of things.</p><figure name="0bdc" id="0bdc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xPc-DYTKbP1uLDwc_0VXtA.jpeg" data-width="600" data-height="398" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xPc-DYTKbP1uLDwc_0VXtA.jpeg"></figure><p name="b89e" id="b89e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Other thing which needs commendation is the online schools. Credit to the sites which made the online school possible. The teachers and kids adapted well to the situation but without those sites it would have been really really difficult. Not only schools but other activities are easily being conducted and it also doesn’t matter if one is in the same city or some other city. Official work are being managed easily from home all because of the development of technology. If the technology support was not there the condition would have been much difficult then it is now.</p><p name="995f" id="995f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The families and the extended families are coming closer as people are frequently having video calls and meetings with each other. This is also because of technology and ease of using it.</p><p name="ac09" id="ac09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surprisingly when I look into these things it feels as if it was all a preperation for dealing with the pandemic.</p><figure name="efa7" id="efa7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pdHCgyE7S0Il6Z5CtN5c1g.jpeg" data-width="1000" data-height="650" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pdHCgyE7S0Il6Z5CtN5c1g.jpeg"></figure><p name="81f9" id="81f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I am thankful to the scientists of our country. Who instead of sulking about the loss which the pandemic has brought are tirelessly working towards the ways to deal with it. I am proud of the vaccine which was indegenously developed. Also I am super proud of DRDO for developing a medicine to cure the covid 19 infection . I appreciate how the scientists of IISC and many other institutes are diligently working on finding new and better instruments for testing of coronavirus and also to test for antibodies.</p><p name="e9da" id="e9da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It might come across to many that I am someone who is ignorant or insensitive towards the pain and suffering of the countless people due to pandemic, but that’s not true. With so many news media giving all possible information about the sufferings how can one be ignorant. But then I chose to stay ignorant of the negetivity which is being spread and as they say “ignorance is a bliss&quot;. Why not think about what good is happening around instead of suffering. Suffering is there right now but it won’t be for long but it is very important to keep thinking positive as if it effects the mental health, it will be a constant even after the pandemic is gone. I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I am thankful to everyone who are working tirelessly to reach the end of the tunnel fast.</p><p name="c358" id="c358" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Till then pose for a picture, enjoy your tea with family and be witty enough to not to fall for the negative news being spread by some opportunists.</p><figure name="a8f8" id="a8f8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6eksPxitcQSBrgQl60goBQ.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="900" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6eksPxitcQSBrgQl60goBQ.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
