When one plans for a vacation there is something to look forward to. I have experienced that even before going for a vacation I start feeling happy just by preparing for it. Before every vacation we plan what all we will do where we will stay and the best part is I head shopping as I love to wear everything new when on vacation. It’s like a festival for me.</p><p name="3de1" id="3de1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For quite sometime we are not able to go for a vacation because of covid situation.
