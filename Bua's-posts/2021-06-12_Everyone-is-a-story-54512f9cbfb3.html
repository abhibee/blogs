Whenever we meet someone,talk to them, many stories are shared which helps us to form an image of that person. It also helps in understanding life and gaining different experiences. It is obvious that it is out of the capacity of a man to understand the world fully. But as we meet different people we gain different perceptions of seeing life. Whenever we hear stories of real people we gain something new. Sometimes I have experienced that someone’s problem can be someone else’s freedom. For example it can be a necessity for someone to work for earning whereas for someone it is just a hobby or an outlet to meet people . Everyone’s definition of happiness is different. Even the way of looking at some issue is different at different ages. I have seen people’s perception change with time too.</p><p name="9eaa" id="9eaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Man is a social animal. We live together in a community. Living together is not just when one needs help the others are always there but also one needs people to hear them and just listen to what they have to say, to share different ideas etc. One needs to go to the real world to understand that any problem is not a problem and it’s just a matter of time and circumstances which pose it like a problem. A poor person who is working very hard to meet his needs can be happy but a rich man having all the amenities in life could be unhappy and stressed. It’s just an Outlook.</p><p name="5b75" id="5b75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every man is a hero of their own story. But they should even be the director of their own stories. No one else should direct someone , that is one should not give his key to happiness in someone else’s hands. One should be in control of their life and no one else. As well wishers only have the right to give suggestions but one should have the freedom to write the script of their story. That way different stories are created. Some stories are inspiring to everyone and those create history. Every inspiring story that we hear shows how the person has carved their ways through ups and downs of life and written a script of their life in such a way that is noteworthy.</p><p name="7aef" id="7aef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stories are not just stories. If one wants thay can surely take something out of everyone’s story and either incorporate or abandon few things in their lives appropriately, to make their life story worth remembering. There is no guarantee of happiness or success in anything, as a matter of fact happiness and success are very subjective, but at least there will be a story which will be remembered for long.</p><figure name="fc38" id="fc38" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Wgy2gJVXJB26VOD52tynNg.jpeg" data-width="472" data-height="394" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wgy2gJVXJB26VOD52tynNg.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
