We had recently shifted to the city and the house was in total mess as renovation work was going on. It was Sunday,12 th of May 2019 when we were sitting casually and chatting. Suddenly we decided to bring a pup home as kids were bit unsettled because of movement and it would be fun for them to have a friend around. It was a big decision as it’s a big responsibility.</p><p name="d593" id="d593" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it was a coincidence that we found a litter of cocker spaniel ready to be adopted nearby, refered by a friend. Within an hour we started to bring the little one home. Can’t explain the excitement which we all experienced. Before going further let me tell you about how I feared dogs. I never envisaged of having a pet dog of my own. I would not go to anyone’s house if their dogs were not leashed. I was even scared of stray dogs and avoided them as much as possible. Now you know why it was a big decision for me.</p><p name="3347" id="3347" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We reached the place and was first greeted by the parents of the puppies, two of them were gorgeous. The mother was a golden cocker and the father was black one. Their litter had 3 male pups and 4 female pups. All of them were adorable. Out of them this one was beautiful black, smaller and calmer than others and was sleeping carefree. I took him in my palms and instantly knew that he is the one who has chosen me. After getting basic information about what to feed him and how to keep him warm and safe we brought him home. He had such deep little eyes which anyone would fall for. He was a little bigger than the size of my palm. Since then he has grown a lot but still a gentle carefree and a loving being. I am not scared of dogs anymore as he has taught me a different language, the language of love.</p><p name="69de" id="69de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The day I met him was a special day for me as I have grown a lot as a human after meeting him. It’s amazing how a being can teach you to love more, to laugh more and to live more than you yourself can ever learn.</p><figure name="9930" id="9930" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qQ_y5umsTIMUvP-CsjzXrQ.jpeg" data-width="768" data-height="1024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qQ_y5umsTIMUvP-CsjzXrQ.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
