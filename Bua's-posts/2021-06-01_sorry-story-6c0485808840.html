To err is human. Once in a while knowingly unknowingly everyone is bound to make mistakes. Sometimes one does not even realise that he/she is making a mistake. On realisation if a person’s consience gets hurt, one may feel guilt. The guilt sometimes drag a person towards depression. That is why it is very important to come out of it as soon as possible. One best way to remove the guilt is to say sorry as soon as one realises the mistake.</p><p name="f795" id="f795" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other person who is hurt may or may not forgive you but at least one can clear his/her conscience by saying sorry. If someone is remorseful and guilt stricken and is feeling sorry from his heart then even God forgives his mistakes.</p><p name="f56b" id="f56b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Saying sorry does not make a person lesser in fact it shows that his heart is pure. It shows how he/she is repenting and wants to make ammends. In my opinion it is better to say sorry than to loose someone important in your life.</p><p name="915c" id="915c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sometimes saying sorry is too much difficult because its humiliating to accept ones mistakes. But once done i am sure one feels lighter and better. Saying you’re sorry is potent medicine for the giver and receiver. It takes a strong person to say sorry but even stronger person to forgive. But even if saying sorry is the most difficult thing to do but its the most inexpensive thing which can save the priceless relations.</p></div></div></section>
