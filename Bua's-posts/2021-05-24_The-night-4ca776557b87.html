Childhood memories are the best memories which always bring smile back to the face. Incidents can be happy,sad scary,or anything but once it becomes a memory it is always nice. Every moment which passes by may touch you in a way that becomes a memory. You must live in present but revisit the memories once in a while to feel good or sometimes to stay grounded and sometimes to remember someone fondly. One such memory of my childhood I want to revisit today.</p><p name="9d1a" id="9d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once a death happened in extended family and my parents had to travel to another city for a couple of days. I, my brother, who is 2 years older than me and my cousin, who is my age were alone at home all by ourselves. We stayed in a duplex house and just outside my room there was a guava tree which was visible from the window of my room. At night it used to be dark with little light from the street lamps playing hide and seek. The shadow of the tree moving with the wind gave an spooky feeling of some one moving.</p><figure name="44c1" id="44c1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*miKo4rqxyj-slhmdXn0D2w.jpeg" data-width="598" data-height="900" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*miKo4rqxyj-slhmdXn0D2w.jpeg"></figure><p name="af05" id="af05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">At that time a horror show used to air on the television called &#39; aahat&#39; every Wednesday. It was Wednesday night and three of us watched that program and it was a fearsome story which I still remember. We all were too much scared but then in a competition to show who is the bravest we did not show how scared we were from within. I and my cousin were sleeping in my room and my brother was in another room. Actually all of us were too terrified to sleep but were just lying down reciting prayers in our hearts. And then the spectral guava tree was also adding to the uncanny atmosphere. Suddenly my cousin sensed my brother was sitting on the stairs . It was around 12 am at that time. She told me to come with her and check why bhaiya is sitting there at this time. We went and called him a few times but he did not respond. At this point we were petrified. She gently put her hand on his shoulder and said bhaiya and in a sudden movement he faced towards us. It was a scene just out of the horror show we watched, his eyes were blood shot and with a scream we ran and banged the door of our room and sat inside hugging each other. He came and knocked at the door but we were not ready to open it. It was the night which is etched in our memory.</p><figure name="c731" id="c731" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HZSnSBvBPY_A_NSlkpmrHA.jpeg" data-width="511" data-height="800" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HZSnSBvBPY_A_NSlkpmrHA.jpeg"></figure><p name="553f" id="553f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Next day morning when we opened the door terrified because of the events of the night, we were amazed to find my brother laughing hysterically. Then he narrated the story of the events of that night. He told us that after we went to our room he cooked the plan to scare us further. Then he put a little soap in his eyes which obviously burnt a lot and turned red. He then sat on the stairs making sure that we notice him and rest all was clear. He got a good thrashing from us . But then we all laughed a lot and still do whenever we meet.</p><figure name="1a86" id="1a86" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oNTHGbWf5zsdFWFRmiZdAg.jpeg" data-width="371" data-height="196" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oNTHGbWf5zsdFWFRmiZdAg.jpeg"></figure><p name="b094" id="b094" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are so many memories of that time which is unforgettable and we love to revisit them to bring out the child in ourselves.</p><p name="1395" id="1395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The moment lasts for seconds but memories last forever.</em></strong></p></div></div></section>
