These are aspects which knows nothing else about the person.</p><p name="fc2c" id="fc2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whenever we look(just the first look) at someone the things we notice could be their hair, clothes, nose, or figure. But does that really defines a person. The answer is an obvious no. People are defined by their personality traits not physical traits. Secondly it is criminal to judge people like that, everyone is created unique by the almighty and who are we to judge His creations.</p><p name="c98c" id="c98c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our society places particular value on physical characteristics. Curvy body shapes, long legs and luxurious hair are characteristics that are often seen as desirable in women. For men it might include characteristics such as muscularity, tallness and a firm jawline. Many advertisement,films,print media or even watsapp jokes advocates the physical beauty, explicitly or implicitly. Everything we see is beautified. This creates an unrealistic image in the young minds and they start seeing problem in themselves. There are so many filters which the youngsters have started using while getting pictures clicked. The advertising industry does nothing but try to sell products by moulding people’s psyche. While doing this they distort the reality of normal into the unreality of ideals such as the so-called ideal of women being size zero. Many girls fall into this trap and they start starving leading to health problems. It is painful for parents to see their children like this. In some cases the parents too are part of this problem where they also stop seeing beyond the bodily image. This needs to stop and stop immediately.</p><p name="2029" id="2029" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ideal of attractiveness should not be based on physical characteristics rather than personality traits such as kindness, intelligence, thoughtfulness, sense of humour etc. One need to accept their bodies as it is. But that really does not mean that one should not take care of their bodies. Our body is the home of our soul and we need to keep it healthy. Health cannot be equated to appearance but the overall wellness of the body. The word health refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. One must give a little time everyday working towards having a healthy body. A healthy body promotes self confidence and much more.</p><figure name="174f" id="174f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ZGMG9Mn1LPuJ4JFlGZ1_hw.jpeg" data-width="736" data-height="442" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZGMG9Mn1LPuJ4JFlGZ1_hw.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
