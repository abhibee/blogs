It was a very interesting thing to do. Sometimes few of the sentences turned out to be very funny when translated. It is because the sentences loose it’s essence when translated if not done with the cultural understanding of the situation. Take for instance an Indian is talking to a person from some other country and he is communicating by translation of his thoughts in hindi to english and he needs to add a proverb or an idiom in hindi and translates it to English . Proverbs and idioms are so typical to the region that they don’t function in another language. For example, there is an expression in hindi &#39;oonth ke munh mein jeera&#39; which an Indian would perceive immediately that a small black cumin seed won’t feel like much in the mouth of a camel, and is absolutely inadequate as a meal for the big animal. But when translated it becomes ‘cumin seed in a camel’s mouth’ .Not only does it sound odd and completely awkward in English, it also has no meaning in a culture where the spice cumin doesn’t belong in the everyday life, and even less so the camel. Thus translating from Hindi to English not only requires linguistic skills but also cultural understanding.</p><figure name="b42f" id="b42f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Yas9zBGUc2vbJtnnGOC3oQ.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1008" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Yas9zBGUc2vbJtnnGOC3oQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="ab28" id="ab28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Also if a hindi song is translated to English, say the song &#39; zindagi dhoop tu Ghana saaya&#39; which is a sweet romantic song in hindi, because of overwhelming heat of the Indian summer where some shade is a welcome rescue from the burning sun. But if translated in front of a person of some cold country where people crave for sunlight and it’s an object of desire, it looses it’s essence and the romance in the song would be destroyed.<br> <br>It’s clear that translation requires not just linguistic but also cultural competence. And one need to explain the regional as well as cultural background while translating the sentences to convey the real meaning to the listener.</p><p name="332a" id="332a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">These days there are so many translator apps which translate hindi to english or to any other language. But the problem is it needs a human touch as well as understanding to translate the real meaning from any language to another. The translations by these apps are even more hilarious sometimes. Though they are not absolutely perfect but at least anyone can now translate a little and can communicate. It may not be perfect but it is still useful and we cannot write them off for this shortcoming.</p></div></div></section>
