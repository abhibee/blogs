All my cousin’s used to love candies and would buy them and eat them. I never used to eat candies even if someone gifted one to me. I liked chocolates but not in bars, I liked choclate flavour ice creams and cakes. When we were growing up choclate bars was a luxury. But my loving father used to get one for us quite often. He specially made sure to get one each for me and my brother on Christmas Eve and put it beneath our pillow as a surprise for us. I used to save my choclate to share with my best friend who used to do the same with her choclate.</p><figure name="5800" id="5800" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0tP8qPsUMprU42iiMrF0Ew.jpeg" data-width="1500" data-height="998" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0tP8qPsUMprU42iiMrF0Ew.jpeg"></figure><p name="c775" id="c775" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Then I grew up, got married. My husband and kids are candy and chocolate lovers too. Now that the chocolates and candies are available in abundance they just wipe out the stuff and sometimes I find empty wrappers in the fridge. This used to annoy me a lot. I never thought I will eat and want to eat more and more candies until the launch of a particular candy.</p><p name="86b1" id="86b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2015 DS group launched a candy called pulse which was raw mango flavored candy with some masala inside. It was amazing in taste. My husband had it in office and got few for me. He asked me to taste just one and it was something which was very different from regular candy. This was the candy for me. I asked him to get more and even now if I sometimes wish to eat candies that is my only choice.</p><p name="0d1b" id="0d1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Interesting facts about the pulse candy is that within 8 months of launch pulse did a business of 100 crores which was a record of sorts. Since indians love to eat raw mango along with salt and spices, it was a brilliant idea to mix both and present it as a candy. Another interesting fact is the company did not spend a lot on its advertising in fact the candy became popular because of the word of mouth. It’s amazing isn’t it.</p><p name="c5a6" id="c5a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I play candy crush sometimes but that has not helped, I still don’t have crush on candies. But I like to crush the pulse under my teeth and enjoy the tanginess which takes me to my childhood when we used to eat raw mangos with spices.</p></div></div></section>
