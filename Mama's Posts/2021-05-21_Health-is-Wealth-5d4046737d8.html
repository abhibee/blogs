It brings in desired Happiness, Enjoyment and Pleasure. … Simply the Possessions of money/ things don’t make an individual Rich, It is Good Health. This implies that Health strongly influences a person’s capability to enjoy the Wealth which he might have amassed</p><p name="b37a" id="b37a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have always personally believed health is the most important</p><p name="62ce" id="62ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During my college days, I became aware of yoga and aerobics. I joined aerobic classes and used to enjoy it very much. Post-college I started to put on little weight. At that time I realized if I don’t take care now it can be a problem later. So I joined a workout center called Soumen workout which was very famous in Kolkata. I was running my boutique in those days. In the evening after my boutique, I used to go straight for exercise. This routine continued for a year. I became obsessed with exercise. I was conscious about my food habits also. I could see a remarkable change in me and I was enjoying it. The gym owner even wanted me to model for their center. Before and after pictures they wanted to put all across Kolkata. But I denied it.</p><p name="f444" id="f444" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even in Banglore after my pregnancy, I joined a gym for one year. I love exercising and again I could see a remarkable change in me. I was following a diet plan also.</p><p name="bbeb" id="bbeb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I feel with consistency and discipline and dedication we can achieve good health. I always tell kids our body is a gift from god. Treat your body as a temple. Keep it clean and pure inside out and your body will respect you back.</p><figure name="9636" id="9636" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*iIA9WiYStGUTu5A0FjWf1Q.png" data-width="852" data-height="584" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iIA9WiYStGUTu5A0FjWf1Q.png"></figure></div></div></section>
