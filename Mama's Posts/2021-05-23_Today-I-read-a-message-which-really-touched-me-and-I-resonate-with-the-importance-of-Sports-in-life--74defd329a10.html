It has great importance in each stage of life. It also improves the personality of peoples. Sports keep our all organs alert and the heart becomes most stronger by regularly playing some kind of sports.</p><p name="1c5c" id="1c5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all know these things about sports but what playing sports teaches us is LOSING.</p><p name="a39f" id="a39f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sports teaches us to lose. Every time we lose and again get a chance to play. Lossing tells us there is someone else better than you. You have to work hard and come back stronger.</p><p name="63c7" id="63c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I read this article which I totally relate to</p><p name="97a4" id="97a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What Can Children Learn from Losing?</p><p name="2bdb" id="2bdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The feeling of losing and moving on are particular skills children need to develop in order to deal with negative experiences in life when they become older. It might not seem fair to children that one kid can do something faster or better than they can, but parents can teach their children that everyone has different talents and that it is impossible to be good at everything.</p><p name="82fe" id="82fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Research has shown that losing games is helpful for children because it teaches them to show empathy and cope with the experience of losing.</p><p name="407e" id="407e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Christine Carter, who has published books on parenting, says that children need to practice losing in order to be able to cope when they lose in a competition in front of their peers.</p><p name="4a00" id="4a00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Children who do not experience losing can grow up to be anxious, because they start seeing the possibility of not winning as some form of harm and they cannot deal with situations that do not go their way.</p><p name="f5bc" id="f5bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Losing a game is the only way for children to learn from their mistakes and think about strategies to improve. When children improve their skills and win the next time, they do not only get better at the sport or game, but they also learn something new. Learning new things increase children’s confidence and their self-belief and they start to be proud of their abilities.</p><p name="cb1b" id="cb1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When children lose, they also learn to identify themselves with others who have lost. Melody Brook, a therapist in Texas, says that the experience of coping with loss is helping children to show empathy towards other children in the same position. A child that has never lost a game will not realize that everyone struggles in life.</p><p name="71eb" id="71eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, losing shows children that they need to work hard in order to have success because good things are not just handed over to them. These situations also help children to lose with grace in front of others and to be seen as fair losers.</p><p name="c89b" id="c89b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As parents, we should not be disappointed if our child loses a competition. There is always something to learn from every competition.</p><figure name="b052" id="b052" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*z4gxAcSv3NHNwSqtXmAwZA.png" data-width="1040" data-height="304" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z4gxAcSv3NHNwSqtXmAwZA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
