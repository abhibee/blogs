Most of us know about it . But it keeps reminding us about human needs and how sometimes we give importance to one need over other. Each levels is so important. Balance in life is so important.</p><figure name="a375" id="a375" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*OOuaFrJt0zd3KtdcLratKQ@2x.jpeg" data-width="608" data-height="504" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OOuaFrJt0zd3KtdcLratKQ@2x.jpeg"></figure><p name="67fc" id="67fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a theory of motivation which states that five categories of human needs dictate an individual’s behavior. Those needs are physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs</p><h3 name="88ee" id="88ee" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Physiological needs – these are biological requirements for human survival, e.g. air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth,, sleep.</h3><p name="97dd" id="97dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If these needs are not satisfied the human body cannot function optimally. Maslow considered physiological needs the most important as all the other needs become secondary until these needs are met.</p><h3 name="125e" id="125e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2. Safety needs – once an individual’s physiological needs are satisfied, the needs for security and safety become salient. People want to experience order, predictability and control in their lives. These needs can be fulfilled by the family and society (e.g. police, schools, business and medical care).</h3><p name="2717" id="2717" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">For example, emotional security, financial security (e.g. employment, social welfare), law and order, freedom from fear, social stability, property, health and wellbeing (e.g. safety against accidents and injury).</p><h4 name="94b1" id="94b1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">3. Love and belongingness needs – after physiological and safety needs have been fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social and involves feelings of belongingness. Belongingness, refers to a human emotional need for interpersonal relationships, affiliating, connectedness, and being part of a group.</h4><p name="c97d" id="c97d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Examples of belongingness needs include friendship, intimacy, trust, and acceptance, receiving and giving affection, and love.</p><h3 name="5a4d" id="5a4d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">4. Esteem needs are the fourth level in Maslow’s hierarchy and include self-worth, accomplishement and respect. Maslow classified esteem needs into two categories: (i) esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence) and (ii) the desire for reputation or respect from others (e.g., status, prestige).</h3><h3 name="dc89" id="dc89" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">5. Self-actualization needs are the highest level in Maslow’s hierarchy, and refer to the realization of a person’s potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences. Maslow (1943) describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.</h3></div></div></section><section name="ffbf" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b9d3" id="b9d3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">In Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is located at the very top of the pyramid, representing the need to fulfill one’s individual potential. According to Maslow, peak experiences play an important role in self-actualization.</p><h3 name="efb6" id="efb6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Self Actualization is considered Peak Experience by Maslow .</h3><h3 name="1894" id="1894" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Characteristics of Peak Experiences</h3><p name="ed70" id="ed70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fulfillment</strong>: Peak experiences generate positive emotions and are intrinsically rewarding.</p><p name="3374" id="3374" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Significance: Peak experiences lead to an increase in personal awareness and understanding and can serve as a turning point in a person’s life.</p><p name="a198" id="a198" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spiritual: During a peak experience, people feel at one with the world and often experience a sense of losing track of time.</p><p name="6a42" id="6a42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Self Actualization give a person identity and confidence. Sometimes we ignore this .</p><p name="7129" id="7129" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">self-actualization is the ability to become the best version of oneself. We need to always remember this and keep working on it .</p></div></div></section>
