It‚Äôs somewhere where you are loved, respected, and cared for. When you look at it from the outside, home is just a house.</p><p name="b156" id="b156" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">House becomes a home because of the people who live in it. We have heard ‚ÄòHome sweet Home‚Äô, home is where the heart is, Har Ghar Kuch kehta hai.</p><p name="c44c" id="c44c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every home has a story to tell...</p><p name="3673" id="3673" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was born in Kolkata. My first home was my grandfather‚Äòs home in BK P√•l. When I was 6 months old we moved to Lake gardens. We spent 13 years in that home. It was a rented house but my mother made it a beautiful home and I had a beautiful childhood which I still cherish.¬†.. when I was 13 years old we moved to Lake place. My father bought the house. He did not want to stay in a rented house anymore. My mother was very happy to have her own home. I liked my lake gardens home more because I had lots of friends and a place to play a lot. Slowly we adjusted in Lake place. My mother again made it a beautiful and welcoming home with her love and care. We again moved to Elgin Road. I was 17 years old then. My mother was very very happy as this home was a beautiful one and her dream home. We all had a great time in Neelkamal apartment. I finished college. My brother, sister, I all got married in this house. We had a lot of celebrations here. I still miss that home.</p><p name="ef95" id="ef95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2008, I got married and moved to US. Again a new house. Totally new country, new people and a new life. After staying in the protected environment of my mother and father, it was my turn to make this house a home. When I reached Atlanta, I saw it was an empty house. No furniture. Only kitchen appliances. Me and Abhishek decorated the full house and soon it became a home. We had lots of get-togethers. The most important memory is my daughter was born in this home.</p><p name="c73d" id="c73d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2010 we moved to India. Sjr Brooklyn. My new empty house again. We 3 reached with 6 suitcases. We again started our journey to make it a cozy, welcoming home. It‚Äôs been 10 years now. We have beautiful memories here. My son was born‚Ä¶</p><p name="daff" id="daff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a comfortable home now and my kids just love it. When they grow up I know proudly they will be able to say we had a lovely childhood in SJR Brooklyn. Life comes to all full circle.</p><p name="c96d" id="c96d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I changed so many houses but because of the people I stayed with I enjoyed every home and felt at home... I have learned so much... üèö</p><figure name="5f35" id="5f35" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gM0u7dR65QajFYhp_YqoEQ.jpeg" data-width="505" data-height="607" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gM0u7dR65QajFYhp_YqoEQ.jpeg"></figure></div></div></section>
