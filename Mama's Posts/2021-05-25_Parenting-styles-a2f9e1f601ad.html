Itâ€™s essential to ensure your parenting style is supporting healthy growth and development because the way you interact with your child and how you discipline her will influence them for the rest of their life.</p><p name="f5e5" id="f5e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Researchers have identified four types of parenting styles:</p><h3 name="75bf" id="75bf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Authoritarian Parenting</h3><p name="abb0" id="abb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Authoritarian parenting Style From the word authoritarian, we can have an idea that this type of parenting style focuses on imposing authority on children without any exception. Children have to follow whatever their parents say. They also donâ€™t allow kids to get involved in problem-solving challenges or obstacles. Instead, they make the rules and enforce the consequences with little regard for a childâ€™s opinion. Authoritarian parents may use punishments instead of discipline. So rather than teach a child how to make better choices, theyâ€™re invested in making kids feel sorry for their mistakes. Children of authoritarian parents are at a higher risk of developing self-esteem problems because their opinions arenâ€™t valued.</p><h3 name="5470" id="5470" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Authoritative Parenting</h3><p name="8870" id="8870" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Authoritative parents have rules, and they use consequences, but they also take their childrenâ€™s opinions into account. They validate their childrenâ€™s feelings while also making it clear that the adults are ultimately in charge. Authoritative parents invest time and energy into preventing behavior problems before they start. They also use positive discipline strategies to reinforce good behavior, like praise and reward systems. Children with parents who demonstrate this style tend to be self-disciplined and think for themselves. This style is believed to be most beneficial to children.</p><h3 name="83cd" id="83cd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Permissive Parenting</h3><p name="59e0" id="59e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Permissive Parenting StyleIn this style of parenting, parents are lenient, and they only step in when there is a severe issue. They are quite forgiving and might give privileges if a child begs for something. Permissive parents are lenient. They often only step in when thereâ€™s a serious problem. Permissive parents usually take on more of a friend role than a parent role. They often encourage their children to talk with them about their issues, but they typically donâ€™t put much effort into discouraging poor choices or bad behavior.</p><h3 name="62c4" id="62c4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Uninvolved Parenting</h3><p name="b595" id="b595" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Uninvolved Parenting StyleUninvolved parents tend to have little knowledge of what their children are doing. There tend to be few rules. Children may not receive much guidance, nurturing, and parental attention. Uninvolved parents expect children to raise themselves. They donâ€™t devote much time or energy to meeting childrenâ€™s basic needs. Uninvolved parents may be neglectful, but itâ€™s not always intentional. They lack knowledge about child development. And sometimes, theyâ€™re simply overwhelmed with other problems, like work, paying bills, and managing a household. Children with uninvolved parents are likely to struggle with self-esteem issues. They tend to perform poorly in school. They also exhibit frequent behavior problems and rank low in happiness.</p><p name="8985" id="8985" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My viewpoint:</p><p name="93a8" id="93a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel parenting does not follow one theory. It is a balance of all. Parents have to wear different hats and play different roles according to the childâ€™s need, childâ€™s age. Parenting is an ongoing process. Parents also learn with time and it is absolutely ok to say sorry to kids if they feel they are wrong. First parents have to understand child has an identity and personality of his own. Parents are just guides, parents can expose children to different experiences and show them a different path. It is the child who will decide which path they want to follow. Donâ€™t consider a child your property or your puppet. Respect childâ€™s view. Practice what you preach.</p><p name="3fc4" id="3fc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Read and learn from experience.
