Donâ€™t know if they will do. Then Abhishek said we are also doing.. Reema, me and Abhishek.. I was in two mindsÂ .. will I be able to do itÂ . It was in the second week of MayÂ . I was busy planning for my parents 50 th wedding anniversary. We started on 19 thÂ . Still I had not decided whether I will take partÂ , I was questioning myselfâ€Šâ€”â€Šwill I be able to write? Will I be able to do for 30 daysÂ ?</p><p name="581a" id="581a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 pm was the deadline on 19 th to send the blog. 20 th May was the anniversary. My mind was fully engrossed in planning eventÂ . Then through the day I saw everyone one by one shared their blog on whatâ€™s app.. FOMO.. fearing of missing out came in my mindÂ , what my kids will thinkÂ ?? Am I setting a good example for themÂ . So I decided okÂ .. I will take partÂ . I decided at 8.30 and wrote my first blogÂ .. not great but I had satisfaction that I did it and posted at 8.59Â .. yippee I did it..Â !</p><p name="e141" id="e141" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now I have to do for 30 daysÂ .. Next day I wrote.. I somehow enjoyed.. then nextÂ , then nextÂ !Â .. so now for writing for first 10 daysÂ , it became a habit.. l! for all of usÂ .. for me specifically.. now it has become a part of my routine.. and I am loving it!! If we can forgo the initial inhibition and push ourselves then we can do itÂ ..</p><h3 name="e400" id="e400" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p graf--trailing">Happy blogging to allÂ ðŸ˜Š</h3></div></div></section>
