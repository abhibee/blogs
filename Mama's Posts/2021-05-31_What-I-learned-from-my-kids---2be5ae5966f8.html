Parents also learn a lot of things from their children.</p><p name="6ad0" id="6ad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes definitely they learn lot of things from parents but again they are born with there own personality. Some qualities are inborn and some we learn from the environment we provided</p><p name="306c" id="306c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First I learned that now I am a mother. I have someone who looks upon me . I decided to bring them on this earth now it is my responsibility to provide what best I can provide them in my capacity.</p><p name="8608" id="8608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When my daughter Sangini was born.. I became a mother for the first time. I feel in love with her . She became my life. I started reading all books related to parenting, googled all my questions on different stages. Always questioning myself if I am doing things right.</p><p name="43c0" id="43c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today she is 11 years old . A lovely child. I learned dedication, discipline from her . I am learning from her if you start as task finish till the end . I am learning from her to love unconditionally.</p><p name="f84f" id="f84f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I again became a mother when my son was born. I love him. Sangini and Aryaman are similar in many ways still they have there own personality trait which make them different from each other .</p><p name="3d9d" id="3d9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aryaman taught me how to be happy in all situations, finding happiness in everything.. always being excited about small things . He taught me age is just a number and we can learn anything at any age . ( the way he is writing blogs I am so proud of him) I learned about animals from him . The names which I had never heard in my life .</p><p name="c584" id="c584" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My children My Lifeline… ..</p></div></div></section>
