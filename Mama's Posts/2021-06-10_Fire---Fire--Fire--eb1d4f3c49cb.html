Fire! Fire!</p><p name="309a" id="309a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was in 2008 MayÂ .. 13 years ageÂ . I was in Kolkata with my parents at our Neel kamal homeÂ . My sister had visited us from Mumbai with her 4 years old daughter. My bhabhi went to Nagpur with Malvika and LavanyaÂ . Amit was in DelhiÂ . So 5 of us were in the house. Our Raju Chachaji visited to meet papa. Our servant Shankar was in the kitchen cooking. He came and said it is getting very hot in kitchen. He could hear lot of noiseÂ . People were shouting fire ðŸ”¥.. fire ðŸ”¥. He looked down from our utility. What a siteÂ .. he could only see smoke coming upÂ . By that time the noise had become louder and closerÂ .</p><p name="b0de" id="b0de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We opened out main gate and saw people rushing up and down. We came to know there is fire in first floor. It was my friends house. They were not at home and Air conditioner had burstedÂ . The fire and spread in there full houseÂ . As no one was at home it could not be controlled and started to spread.</p><p name="4867" id="4867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everyone was asked to leave the houseÂ . Power went offÂ . We just took keys and phone and left the house. It was around 8 in the evening. We were in our corridor.. it was pitch darkÂ . We could not make out any thing. Smoke was fuming. We could not breathÂ . As we were on the 8 th floor. Going down was impossible. Only place was terrace. But it was locked. We were going turn by turn near a small opening in the corridor to get fresh airÂ . We were going breathless.</p><p name="9892" id="9892" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What was going in my mind that timeÂ ?? My parents had plans to go for movie but my chachaji came so they cancelled the planÂ . If they went me, my sister and Ananya would only be at homeÂ . They would be watching movie clueless of what is going on at homeÂ . My chacha ji was destined to experience thisÂ .Â .. I was thinking.. how long we will have to be hereÂ .. what will happen if fire brigade does not comeÂ .. what if fire is not controlled and it spreads moreÂ .. these thoughts were running in my mind suddenly we hear someone shouting.. terrace is openÂ .. come fast.. Really?? How did that happen.. who opened the terrace? From where they got keys.. no idea till nowÂ ..</p><p name="9858" id="9858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What a relief it was when we reached terrace. The whole experience lasted for 3 hoursÂ . When fire had subsided. We went homeÂ . But power cut was still thereÂ . The smell of smoke was still thereÂ . We went to sleep.. thinking what a dayÂ ?? Anything can happen any time and you donâ€™t get time to think or planÂ .</p><p name="7169" id="7169" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three to four days we could not stay in the house because of power cut and smellÂ . We stayed in our Lake place house.</p><p name="324d" id="324d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Few incident in life you cannot forget..</p></div></div></section>
