Then the fox said I am not in the desert i am in the forest. The Fox said I was going to say why were you in the forest. And then they chated then they both bumped into a wall then they said together The fox said I never saw that wall ever in the forest and the camel said I never saw that wall ever in the desert. Then they saw lord Krishna said you are cursed by lord Yama because you killed his brother. We did kill his brother by mistake just then they saw they were in a grassland they said together then what am I doing here and they went home and they lived happily ever after the end</p><figure name="8a64" id="8a64" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MSNW4MJrXCXP6c1QY76yuA.png" data-width="682" data-height="350" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MSNW4MJrXCXP6c1QY76yuA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
