Many great warriors were martyred in this first war for independence of India. Many stories of their valour is popular and is told from generation to generation. Among them is the story of Veer Kunwar Singh and his brother Amar Singh of Jagdispur.</h4><h4 name="794d" id="794d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Kunwar Singh was born on 13 November 1777 to Maharaja Sahibzada Singh and Maharani Panchratan Devi, in Jagdispur of the Shahabad District, in the state of Bihar. He belonged to the Ujjainiya clan of the Parmar Rajputs and his father was the Talukdar of Jagdispur. He was described by a British judicial officer as</h4><blockquote name="caab" id="caab" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">….a tall man about six feet in height and having a broad face with an aquiline nose.</blockquote><h4 name="5467" id="5467" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">He was a keen huntsman and also enjoyed horse riding. He had inherited his loathing for the British from his father who was a staunchly anti-British. He married the daughter of Raja Fateh Naraiyan Singh, a wealthy zamindar of the Deo-Munga estate in Gaya district who belonged to the Sisodia clan of Rajputs. Upon the death of his father in 1826, Kunwar Singh became the taluqdar of Jagdispur. He was an environmentalist, it is said as soon as he ascended the throne he began a dedicated campaign for the afforestation of the region which played a vital role in his freedom struggle.</h4><figure name="8056" id="8056" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xUa9NRRFvwVOu-nPMhqFMA.jpeg" data-width="136" data-height="214" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xUa9NRRFvwVOu-nPMhqFMA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Babu Amar Singh [2]</figcaption></figure><h4 name="d490" id="d490" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Amar Singh was the second son of Sahebzada Singh born many years after his older brother. He was described as being tall, fair complexioned and having a mole on the right side of his nose. He was a skilled huntsman and enjoyed hunting big game including elephants, bears and wolves. He was also an extremely devout man and had the Mahabharata recited to him every night.</h4><h4 name="a765" id="a765" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Kunwar Singh and Amar Singh were a threat to the East India Companies rule in India because of their adeptness at guerrilla warfare, the war tactic that made Chhatrapati Shivaji an invincible warrior against his rivals. This made them a pain in the neck for the company’s soldiers. The forests of Arrah which were grown by Kunwar Singh with much care acted as an impregnable fortress against the British because of his expertise at guerrilla warfare.</h4><h4 name="7731" id="7731" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">In 1857, Kunwar Singh as an octogenarian took the reigns of the sepoy mutineers of the 7th, 8th and 40th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed at Danapur. His age and failing health did not deter him from playing an instrumental role in the siege of Arrah in Bihar. Because of his utter dislike for the British rule in India, he took this as the last opportunity to serve his country. He was assisted by both his brother, Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. Babu Amar Singh was initially reluctant to join the rebellion but agreed to do so on the insistence of his brother and the commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. The sepoys of 7th, 8th and 40th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry had been recruited entirely from Shahabad district and were loyal to the local zamindar Kunwar Singh</h4><figure name="c3dc" id="c3dc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DYVzKzjHrm8LCW5g8e4p7A.jpeg" data-width="700" data-height="436" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DYVzKzjHrm8LCW5g8e4p7A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Kunwar Singh and his attendants [3]</figcaption></figure><h4 name="5baf" id="5baf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, with the cooperation of the prison guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the prison guards) then surrounded Richard Vicar Boyle’s house. Richard was the District Engineer with the East Indian Railway Company and the Britishers had taken shelter in his house. A siege soon ensued – eighteen civilians and 50 loyal sepoys from the Bengal Military Police Battalion under the command of Herwald Wake, the local magistrate, defended the house against artillery and musketry fire from an estimated 2000 to 3000 mutineers and rebels.</h4><h4 name="61eb" id="61eb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">On 29 July 400 men from British army were sent out from Danapur to relieve Arrah, but this force was ambushed by the rebels around a mile away from the siege house, severely defeated, and driven back. On 30 July, Major Vincent Eyre, who was going up the river with his troops and guns, reached Buxar and heard about the siege. He immediately disembarked his guns and troops (the 5th Fusiliers) and started marching towards Arrah, disregarding direct orders not to do so. On 2 August, some 6 miles (9.7 km) short of Arrah, the Major was ambushed by the mutineers and rebels. After an intense fight, the 5th Fusiliers charged and stormed the rebel positions successfully. On 3 August, Major Eyre and his men reached the siege house and successfully ended the siege.</h4><figure name="6db0" id="6db0" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5fFtEd_5wzbgP2V_txkWPQ.png" data-width="1744" data-height="1158" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5fFtEd_5wzbgP2V_txkWPQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">“Defence of the Arrah House, 1857” by William Tayler [4]</figcaption></figure><h4 name="e230" id="e230" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">During the rebellion, the sepoys had to cross the Ganges river. Douglas’ army began to shoot at their boat. One of the bullets shattered Kunwar Singh’s left wrist. Singh felt that his hand had become useless and that there was the additional risk of infection due to the bullet-shot. He drew his sword and cut off his left hand near the elbow and offered it to the Ganges.</h4><h4 name="81bb" id="81bb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">After receiving reinforcements, Major Eyre pursued Kunwar Singh to his palace in Jagdispur; however, Singh had left by the time Eyre’s forces arrived. Eyre then proceeded to destroy the palace and the home of Singh brothers.</h4><h4 name="8b8d" id="8b8d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">The brothers left their ancestral village and reached Lucknow in December 1857 where they met with other rebel leaders. In March 1858 they occupied Azamgarh and managed to repel the initial British attempts to take the area. However, they had to leave the place soon. Pursued by Brigadier Douglas, Kunwar Singh retreated towards his home in Arrah, Bihar.</h4><h4 name="c80d" id="c80d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">On 23 April, Kunwar Singh had a victory near Jagdispur over the force led by Captain le Grand (le gard in Hindi). In his last battle, fought on 23 April 1858, near Jagdispur, the troops under the control of the East India Company were completely routed. On 22 and 23 April, being injured he fought bravely against the British Army and with the help of his army drove away the British Army, brought down the Union Jack from Jagdispur Fort and hoisted a saffron banner. He returned to his palace on 23 April 1858 and soon died on 26 April 1858.</h4><h4 name="fee7" id="fee7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">The mantle of the old chief now fell on his brother Babu Amar Singh who, despite all the difficulties, continued the struggle and for a considerable time, running a parallel government in the district of Shahabad. Four days after the death of his brother, he heard reports about British tax collectors in Arrah. He subsequently led an attack on them and defeated them. He was assisted by his commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh.</h4><figure name="cbda" id="cbda" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nDhkfLHJbiv1OGCWBH8vbA.jpeg" data-width="400" data-height="273" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nDhkfLHJbiv1OGCWBH8vbA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Victory of Kunwar Singh in Jagdishpur[5]</figcaption></figure><h4 name="fc58" id="fc58" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">On the 6th of June 1858, Amar Singh and his force of 2000 sepoys and 500 sawars arrived in the village of Gahmar in Ghazipur near the border with Bihar. The Sakarwar Rajput rebels from this region, under the leadership of Meghar Singh, were keen for Amar Singh’s support and a letter was composed in a village requesting his help. Amar Singh accepted their request. Meghar Singh personally presented Amar Singh with a nazrana or gift worth Rs 20,000. They exchanged supplies and Amar Singh left Gahmar on the 10th of June. Among the motivations for this alliance were the marital ties shared between the Sakarwars and the Ujjainiyas.</h4><h4 name="d1f3" id="d1f3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">In October 1859, after subsequent guerilla skirmishes with the British, Amar Singh fled with other rebel leaders to the Nepal Terai. He went into hiding after this but was captured later that same year and died in captivity. Thus marking end of their struggle for their Motherland but this was not the real end as they inspired many to keep the struggle alive till our motherland was free from the foreign rulers.</h4><h4 name="b1af" id="b1af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">To honour Kunwar Singh’s contribution to India’s freedom movement, the Republic of India issued a commemorative stamp on 23 April 1966. The Government of Bihar established the Veer Kunwar Singh University, Arrah in 1992.</h4><figure name="36eb" id="36eb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dIwov3KrRsTVAj85C1Lc9A.jpeg" data-width="100" data-height="135" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dIwov3KrRsTVAj85C1Lc9A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">commemorative stamp of Kunwar Singh in 1966 [6]</figcaption></figure><h4 name="9067" id="9067" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">In 2017, the Veer Kunwar Singh Setu, also known as the Arrah – Chhapra Bridge, was inaugurated to connect north and south Bihar.In 2018, to celebrate 160th anniversary of Kunwar Singh’s death, the government of Bihar relocated a statue of him to Hardinge Park. The park was also officially renamed as ‘Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park’.</h4><h4 name="323d" id="323d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Salute to such bravehearts, the pride of our
