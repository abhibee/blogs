              who have made a mark on not only us but also worldwide. One such personality is Shri Robindro Nath Thakur
              also known as Rabindranath Tagore, a pride of our great nation. Today on 7th of may we commomorate his 160
              birth anniversary .</p>
            <p name="64c6" id="64c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was the youngest
              son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj. He came from a long line of aristocratic upper
              caste Brahmins. He was homeschooled till seventeen. His sister-in-law Kadambari Devi paid an instrumental
              role in framing his character. Kadambari Devi was 10 when she was married to Jyotirindranath Tagore almost
              the same age as Rabindranath who was nine, therfore she acted as a companion and friend for Rabindranath
              Tagore and later acted as a motherly figure on the death of the mother of Rabindranath. After that he was
              sent to England for formal schooling because his father wanted him to become a barrister, but he did not
              finish his studies there instead he opted for independant study of Shakespeare’s plays <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Coriolanus</em>, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Antony and
                Cleopatra and the Religio Medici of Thomas Browne.</em> In his mature years, in addition to his
              many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close
              touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms.</p>
            <p name="b95a" id="b95a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also started an experimental school at
              Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the
              Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way . Gandhi, the political
              father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in
              1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against Jallianwala Bagh and imposition
              of martial law in Punjab. He also recieved the Nobel Price in Literature in 1913 “because of his
              profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic
              thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West.”</p>

            <p name="e1c2" id="e1c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Tagore had early success as a writer in his
              native Bengal. With his translations of some of his poems he became rapidly known in the West. In fact his
              fame attained a luminous height, taking him across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship.
              For the world he became the voice of India’s spiritual heritage; and for India, especially for Bengal, he
              became a great living institution.</p>

            <p name="0568" id="0568" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although Tagore wrote successfully in all
              literary genres, he was first of all a poet. Among his fifty and odd volumes of poetry are <em

                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Sonar Tari</em> (1894) [The Golden Boat], <em

              </em>(1916) [The Flight of Cranes]. Tagore’s major plays are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Raja</em>
              (1910) [<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The King of the Dark Chamber</em>], <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Dakghar</em> (1912) [<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Post

                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Red Oleanders</em>]. He is the author of several volumes of short
              stories and a number of novels, among them <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gora</em> (1910), <em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ghare-Baire</em> (1916) [<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Home

              Besides these, he wrote dramas <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Chandalika</em> [Untouchable Girl] and
              <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Raktakarabi</em> [Blood Oleanders], short stories such as <em

                class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kshudita Pashan</em> [The Hungry Stones, published in August 1895], and
              Atithi [The Runaway, 1895], travel diaries, and two autobiographies, one in his middle years and the other
              shortly before his death in 1941. Tagore also left numerous drawings and paintings. He was an important
              contributer to the Bengal School of Art. Tagore was also prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his
              credit which are popularly known as Rabindra Sangeet. He has also composed the Indian National Anthem
              ‘Jana Gana Mana’ and the Bangladesh National Anthem ‘Amar Shonar Bangla’.</p>

            <p name="79b7" id="79b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">His last five years were marked by chronic
              pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained
              comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never
              recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest. A period of prolonged agony ended
              with Tagore’s death on 7 August 1941, aged 80. Even today his death is mourned all over the world. His
              death can be summed up by his own quote:</p>
            <p name="e19a" id="e19a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Death is not extinguishing the light; it is only putting out the lamp
                because the dawn has come.”</em></p>
            <p name="6271" id="6271" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In today’s testing times it is important to
              learn from the great maestro. He had famously said:</p>
            <p name="6067" id="6067" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em
                class="markup--em markup--p-em">“If I can’t make it through one door, I’ll go through another door- or
                i’ll make a door. Something terrific will come no matter how dark the present.”</em></p>
            <p name="c70d" id="c70d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though the present is dark right now we
              need to keep striving for opportunities and something terrific will always come our way and even if
              nothing seems coming our way just like he said we need to make the opportunity for ourselves after all
              necessity is the mother of all invention.</p>
