I first thought the battery went so I plugged it in but suddenly my voice came from inside the iPad.</p><figure name="5fa4" id="5fa4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*54H3GH_kwU0q2_Yt6yGELg@2x.jpeg" data-width="3088" data-height="2316" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*54H3GH_kwU0q2_Yt6yGELg@2x.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Nath Skand</figcaption></figure><p name="2f61" id="2f61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Suddenly, my video appeared on the screen but with small mouth. I asked, “who are you”. He said “Nath Skand am I”. I could not understand so I asked where are you from he replied “?Earth2 from am I?You are who”. At first I got scared and asked, “are you an alien?”. He said, “Universe alternate an from am I, No”. I said excitedly,“I cant believe that there is an another me”.</p><p name="507f" id="507f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nath Skand said, “You found I, God thank. Help our needs Than Danks” . I was confused so I asked him “Who is Than Danks.” He said , “Earth 3 from is Than Danks”. I understood that Than Danks is from an another alternate universe. I said, “ what help does he need?”. Nath Skand said,”Oh sorry I forgot to put my word reverser on. A kidnapper is going to kill Than Danks and if we do not help him we will also disappear from our universe too.” I got scared and said, “So what do we do?”.</p><p name="8f1c" id="8f1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He said,”I am going to send a universe jump hole in your room. You need to jump into it and come over to my universe.” In some seconds a black hole opened under my chair and I dropped into it. I landed in my room again but in an alternate universe. Nath Skand said, “ Let’s go” and an another black hole opened and we landed in the middle of a field on the outskirts of Gurgaon. He told me that Than Danks is trapped in the hut at the edge of the field and that Danks will join us shortly with guns. I asked him, “ Where is Danks Than from now?” He said, “Danks Than is from Earth 4.”</p><figure name="df7c" id="df7c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q_E_DrOsFTzLD_LLCgp0VA@2x.jpeg" data-width="3088" data-height="2316" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q_E_DrOsFTzLD_LLCgp0VA@2x.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Danks Than</figcaption></figure><p name="f90b" id="f90b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A short while later Danks Than jumped from a black hole in front of us. He had a very big elongated face. He had in his hands three snugtosh (shotguns).</p><p name="f311" id="f311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We took one each and went near the hut. We loaded the guns and swung open the door. The kidnapper flung around and we shot at him. the kidnapper evaporated as soon as we hit him with our bullets. Another kidnapper came running. We shot him too and he evaporated. We freed Than Danks after that. Than Danks had a small nose and his eyes were closer than mine. Than Danks thanked us a lot. After that Nath Skand opened a black hole and I landed back in my room. A little while later my chair dropped in my room. At the same time my iPad started buzzing and I saw Than Danks, Danks Than and Nath Skand all in the video call. We talked a lot and then we promised we won’t tell anyone that we have met each other. it was a lovely adventure.</p><figure name="8cb0" id="8cb0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YGNhsvtHAFQUbtNSXIUjjg@2x.jpeg" data-width="3088" data-height="2316" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YGNhsvtHAFQUbtNSXIUjjg@2x.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Than Danks</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
