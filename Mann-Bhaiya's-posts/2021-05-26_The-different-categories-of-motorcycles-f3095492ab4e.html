These are:</p><p name="686a" id="686a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Street / Naked bikes</strong></p><p name="a0c0" id="a0c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Naked Bike, or the standard roadster, is the simplest bike that you have seen. It is the same type of bike the milkman, the guard, the driver, everyone ride. You get to see thousands of them zooming around the roads in your city everyday and they are built for navigation and standard travel. They are recognizable due to their upright riding position. This is midway between the reclining position of the sports bikes and the forward leaning position of most adventure or sport bikes.</p><p name="d170" id="d170" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Standard bikes usually don’t come with fairings or windscreens. They are usually small, if they are featured at all. Standard bikes or naked bikes are usually fitted with cylinders ranging from 125 cc to 1000 cc depending on the price. It is a general purpose bike that is fine for any occasion within acceptable limits of speed and torque.</p><figure name="006e" id="006e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qOOOckWAVQVvxhy8KCUoJw.jpeg" data-width="930" data-height="620" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qOOOckWAVQVvxhy8KCUoJw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Triumph street triple RS</figcaption></figure><p name="9cbf" id="9cbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sport bikes</strong></p><p name="65b9" id="65b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are the faster bikes built with a slanted sitting posture. These bikes give of a lot of heat from the engine, the engine itself has power concentrated at the top of the rev range. They are designed for road racing and they have a streamlined body for better aerodynamics. The engines are big and bulky which can have one, two or three cylinders with capacity ranging from 175cc to 2300cc. If you want to have a fast ride on the weekends or want to show off the awesome burnouts to your colleagues then you can think of buying a sports bike but a sports bike is uncomfortable as a daily rider. The best in line are Suzuki Hayabusa, Kawasaki Ninja H2R and BMW m1000rr.</p><figure name="b1d4" id="b1d4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Y8fVTK7qgiBKXNAtUuv6dA.jpeg" data-width="1620" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Y8fVTK7qgiBKXNAtUuv6dA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">BMW m1000rr</figcaption></figure><p name="0776" id="0776" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cruisers</strong></p><p name="3fe6" id="3fe6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cruisers are designed for cruising off on arrow-straight, smooth roads. Cruisers are stable in a straight line and typically have engines that are relaxed and that put out a lot of torque. These are heavy bikes meant to kiss the road as they glide. The riding position on the cruiser allows you to place your feet forward and hands up. The spine can be erect or can lean back slightly. Though, if you’re looking at exploring off the beaten track, a cruiser won’t be the optimal choice.</p><p name="71ee" id="71ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The cruisers can be divided into Subcategories such as:</p><p name="ca23" id="ca23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">· <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Chopper:</em></p><p name="b134" id="b134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is perhaps the most iconic motorcycle silhouette. The extreme style of this motorbike, which uses modified steering angles and lengthened forks, makes it an aesthetically pleasing sight.</p><p name="9e60" id="9e60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The motorcycle is built from an original motorcycle which is chopped, hence the name. The features that are most iconic are the long front ends which extend like forks. They are also coupled with an increased angle for the rake and hardtail frames. Chopper also is famous as a symbol for masculinity in bikes.</p><p name="6f91" id="6f91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">· <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Power Cruiser</em></p><p name="1ebc" id="1ebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Power cruisers are bikes that are distinct from the normal Cruisers due to their high level of horsepower. Typically their low powered counterparts are mostly known for their ruggedness and toughness, and not their speed. The Power cruisers come with upgraded brakes and suspensions, as well as better ground clearance. They have very premium surface finishes and a more exotic or muscular look than their lesser powered counterparts.</p><figure name="f0b6" id="f0b6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VUtAQaEHoubYxj6byZie7A.jpeg" data-width="450" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VUtAQaEHoubYxj6byZie7A.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Jawa Perak</figcaption></figure><p name="2a7c" id="2a7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Touring</strong></p><p name="4e9c" id="4e9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you like touring long distances, the touring style motorcycle is right for you. It is usually longer than the average bike. It’s comfortable, smooth, stable and offers far more storage compartments than other bikes.</p><p name="6a45" id="6a45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A subcategory of adventure tourer is Adventure Tourer.</p><p name="c07d" id="c07d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Adventure tourers</strong> are tall machines that have massive ground clearance and long-travel suspension. They are the SUV of bikes. You’ll need a little skill to ride one of these, because of the relatively high seat, and riding them on dirt will require quite a bit of practice, so these might not be one of the best choices for a first motorcycle. Once you’re used to one, however, the breadth of their capabilities will quite literally take your breath away.</p><figure name="d153" id="d153" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gGNpcewxa_7lVvAlYyR71w.jpeg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gGNpcewxa_7lVvAlYyR71w.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Honda Gold Wing</figcaption></figure><p name="6d85" id="6d85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Dirt Bikes</strong></p><p name="4340" id="4340" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is currently a very small segment in the Indian market, but it will certainly grow in the future. Dirt bikes are like adventure tourers because they have long-travel suspension and can handle dirt, but they are stripped down to almost nothing in the pursuit of less kerb weight. They have knobby tyres, and small fuel tanks. Most of the time there isn’t a provision for lamps of any kind, so they might not even be road-legal. They’re fantastic for a day out on dirt, but don’t make for such a good experience on tarmac. They are recreational bikes with high price tags and as such haven’t got a lot of customers yet in our market.</p><figure name="ae2f" id="ae2f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LSFkCFFtcvUmr8f97uH5pg.gif" data-width="500" data-height="375" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LSFkCFFtcvUmr8f97uH5pg.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dirt Biking</figcaption></figure><p name="bc11" id="bc11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">6.</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Scooter</strong></p><p name="a49e" id="a49e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Scooters allow you to get around the city and are pretty useful in areas with non highway speeds. They have cylinders ranging from 50 cc to 500 cc in size and they offer a smaller fairing with storage under the seat. Scooter has a few subcategories such as:</p><p name="c208" id="c208" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">· <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Moped:</em></p><p name="8fcb" id="8fcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They have lighter framers than a scooter and are based on the design of a bicycle. They have smaller engines, (of 50 cc or less), and mostly run on electric power rather than gasoline. They are also lightweight and limited on power, hence they’re only suitable for short trips.</p><p name="3217" id="3217" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">· <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Power scooter:</em></p><p name="ea7a" id="ea7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Power Scooters are a burgeoning industry. The aesthetic and the design of the Power scooter are becoming ever more popular with electric vehicle companies. Power scooters usually pack a little more power and energy than regular scooters and are built for better speed and sharper turns. They have step through bodies and enclosed mechanical parts. This design aesthetic prevents the rider from staining or wrinkling their clothes. And it also allows for the scooter to have a lower center of gravity, allowing for better handling and lesser chances of accidents.</p><figure name="47c6" id="47c6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*nPgtEqUZQTjP7_2R6aw2vA.gif" data-width="320" data-height="180" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*nPgtEqUZQTjP7_2R6aw2vA.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Scooter</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
