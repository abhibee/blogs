My father had bought me a new pair of Bata school shoes. The shoes were not the Bata ‘naughty boy’s they were a better model. I was very excited to get them. I had not purchased them personally my father bought from the Bata shop near his office on Camac street. It was a Friday and I went to school on Monday.</p><p name="ee75" id="ee75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On Monday I wore those shoes proudly to school. As usual it was raining in Kolkata that day. I was extremely precautious about not getting them wet. Once I reached my classroom I showed them off to almost everyone and boasted about the lovely cushioning it had. Even in the assembly I boasted about them to almost everyone I met. Oh what a lovely day. I wore those shoes feeling happy about it but something was a little off about the shoes, they were a little loose than the day I got them but I adjusted.</p><figure name="6985" id="6985" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yl62WXpoS8zTJf71JPug6g.jpeg" data-width="600" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yl62WXpoS8zTJf71JPug6g.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">RAIN IN KOLKATA</figcaption></figure><p name="300d" id="300d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After school ended when I reached home my mother asked me “How were the shoes?”. I replied gleefully that they were amazingly comfortable but they are a little loose. My mother laughed at this and said “Obviously they are loose because these are your father’s shoes. This morning when your father was looking for his shoes he couldn’t find it, we thought somebody stole them but that was highly unlikely. But every thing fell in place when we saw your new shoes in the shoe rack”. I was confused I removed them and saw the sole which clearly showed ‘Hush Puppies’. Both my mother and I broke into a laugh. I had by mistake worn my father’s new shoes which he had bought the same weekend from Forum. When my father returned home that night he also laughed with us.</p><figure name="5a8d" id="5a8d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*76mVJbZJ-YQBj0GUWGqcwA.gif" data-width="220" data-height="180" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*76mVJbZJ-YQBj0GUWGqcwA.gif"></figure><p name="65a5" id="65a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Whenever I remember that day I always break into a smile. Memories are made with such simple and small things in life and it bring back happiness whenever revisited.</p></div></div></section><section name="3b79" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="bf18" id="bf18" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Picture Courtesy :</p><ol class="postList"><li name="4bff" id="4bff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">^ https://tenor.com/search/shoes-gifs</li><li name="4817" id="4817" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">^ https://www.skymetweather.com/content/weather-news-and-analysis/rain-in-kolkata-in-next-24-hrs-monsoon-to-strike-by-june-7-9/</li><li name="c89d" id="c89d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">^ https://www.whoa.in/gallery/funny-gif-memes-gif-for-whatsapp-facebook-instagram-laughing-gif-4-memes-gif</li></ol></div></div></section>
