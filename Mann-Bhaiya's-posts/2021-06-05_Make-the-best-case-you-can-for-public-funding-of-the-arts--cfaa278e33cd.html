Art has been used many a times by historians and archaeologists alike to describe the progress of the earlier civilisations. Unfortunately, art is now a dying profession. During the age when monarchy prevailed, the Monarchs were known for their benevolence towards artistes.</p><figure name="08cd" id="08cd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*o5T9xwe-6E29WuFz4SZ_qA.jpeg" data-width="2592" data-height="1688" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*o5T9xwe-6E29WuFz4SZ_qA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Gupta era art</figcaption></figure><p name="e950" id="e950" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This argument can be proved by the fact that Gupta era is not called the Golden era in Indian History because of the profound political system that existed at that time or because of intense industrialisation during that period. The Gupta era is known for the patronage of arts, literature and philosophy at that time. The main reason that the reign of Akbar and Shah Jahan is remembered till now is the encouragement they had given to the artists. Almost everyone knows what Taj Mahal is, but not many people know who Shah Jahan is. The word Akbar is always associated with Tansen who was his witty court musician.</p><figure name="ca42" id="ca42" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jsFOnVau5iIMVkku5GL0Mg.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="1063" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jsFOnVau5iIMVkku5GL0Mg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Taj Mahal</figcaption></figure><p name="8550" id="8550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Unfortunately, the patronage of art and architecture went extinct during the colonisation era. The colonisers were more interested in exploiting the colonies for monetary gains. Earlier singers, dancers, musicians and painters held a very superior position in the society. When countries were colonised the status of these artists was reduced to beggary. The colonisers were brutal in suppression of our such forms. The unjust policies introduced by the colonisers were responsible for widespread decline in art.</p><p name="307c" id="307c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since then, art has not been a very elite profession and has been looked down upon by many. Parental pressure and social pressure forces many individuals to not pursue art as a career.</p><p name="5f0c" id="5f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If art is started to be publicly funded and it is brought in front of the masses. The layman will understand the importance of art. It is important for us to elevate the status of art to where it belongs. The painters, playwrights, dramatists and musicians are a reflection of our society. The future generations will draw inspiration from their works.</p><p name="1346" id="1346" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we provide more funds to the artists they will not be bound by the financial pressure. The artists will be able to expand their mind more and its implication would be unfathomable. The artists will be able to produce masterpieces. During renaissance the princes funded art. Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo and Sandro Botticelli became great painters because they had no lack of funds. They had the resources to focus on making art not on procuring the daily meal. The state of folk artists in India is pretty much the contrary.</p><p name="21d5" id="21d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have lost many art forms along the way. We cannot afford to loose them anymore. These art forms are the reminiscents of our culture and history. It is our responsibility to preserve this culture otherwise the future generations will be bereft of their Identity and culture. In the modern world the burden of preserving these art forms lies on us.</p><p name="1552" id="1552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It is the moral duty of every citizen of a country to fund art. It will help not only to preserve our art forms but also to give birth to new art forms. Only if the people contribute can we reach the next Renaissance, else we will continue to live a colourless and monotonous life.</p></div></div></section><section name="dd29" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><ol class="postList"><li name="891e" id="891e" class="graf graf--li graf--leading">^<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ravi_Varma-Princess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg" data-href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ravi_Varma-Princess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ravi_Varma-Princess_Damayanthi_talking_with_Royal_Swan_about_Nala.jpg</a></li><li name="e4cf" id="e4cf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">^<a href="https://deccanviews.wordpress.com/2017/05/23/art-of-gupta-era-golden-age-of-india/" data-href="https://deccanviews.wordpress.com/2017/05/23/art-of-gupta-era-golden-age-of-india/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://deccanviews.wordpress.com/2017/05/23/art-of-gupta-era-golden-age-of-india/</a></li><li name="6532" id="6532" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">^<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taj-Mahal" data-href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taj-Mahal" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.britannica.com/topic/Taj-Mahal</a></li></ol></div></div></section>
