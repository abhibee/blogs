I was always interested in reading newspapers and was curious about the current affairs. I was contemplating a lot about what i really wanted to pursue. But it was during the Covid lockdown that my real interest developed. My mother who is a CA thought she might utilise the extra time she has in hand to study law. So she started studying law from a private college. I also could hear the discussions in her classes that went on online platform and I got interested in the the things they were talking about in the constitution, the IPC and the law of torts . My mother also started discussing few things with me which enhanced my interest in the feild. Gradually I became very engrossed in these talks and even started researching on some cases.</p><figure name="769a" id="769a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ePbEHLxNwoNmYselAIzzpg.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="678" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ePbEHLxNwoNmYselAIzzpg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">He Kesavananda Bharati vs the State of Kerala</figcaption></figure><p name="c4dd" id="c4dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I researched read the Keshavananda Bharti Case, The Golakhnath vs the state Punjab case, The Maneka Gandhi vs the Union of India, Union Carbide Corporation versus Union of India and the Indira Gandhi vs Raj Narain case. I even took up Emergency as my history project and while I was researching about it I encountered many cases.</p><p name="ec83" id="ec83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also have always had the habit of reading newspapers and I was quite attracted by the news relating to the orders and judgments passed by the courts. And the Supreme Court has been in the news quite a times recently because of their advises to the government. I read more about the various powers of the Supreme Court and how the judges are appointed, the collegium system and the authority that the judges govern.</p><figure name="2155" id="2155" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*RrXzOmS9e0ZnKGarWCaBpw.jpeg" data-width="728" data-height="409" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RrXzOmS9e0ZnKGarWCaBpw.jpeg"></figure><p name="f141" id="f141" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Whenever I see these judgments being passed I believe that lawyers have the power to change the world. They are people with the authority to improvise the society. Whenever I hear stories about the death of animals, the shrinking of forests I know if I become a lawyer I will have the power to fight for their protection.</p><p name="aae2" id="aae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In tenth itself I had made the decision regarding that I want to pursue law and I had acquainted my parents with this decision too and they were happy with my decision. I had not started my research on the prospects at that time because my parents had advised me to focus on boards in the last one or two month. After the boards got canceled I researched more about the prospects of law and after a lot of further research on law I came to the conclusion that I wish to pursue law after 12th.</p><figure name="119c" id="119c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uhq2vB45TTZQNtrJdQhgAQ.jpeg" data-width="347" data-height="497" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uhq2vB45TTZQNtrJdQhgAQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">NLSIU Banglore</figcaption></figure><p name="844a" id="844a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have already started studying for CLAT for admission in The National Law Universities. I also wish to give the LNAT which is the Law National Aptitude Test. The LNAT is applicable to study law from UK universities like LSE, Oxford and UCL. I have done a little research on LNAT and have started practising comprehensions and essays to crack the LNAT. I have also researched the reading I need to do in order to get into Oxford and King’s College London and have already started reading some law books to make myself familiar with Law.</p><figure name="24ed" id="24ed" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9ukvgSg9W6SmvO1USfRZLg.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="1373" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9ukvgSg9W6SmvO1USfRZLg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Brasenose College, University of Oxford</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section name="34a1" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fa10" id="fa10" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Picture Courtesy:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="ca3e" id="ca3e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">^<a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-difference-between-criminal-law-and-civil-law" data-href="https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-difference-between-criminal-law-and-civil-law" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.britannica.com/story/what-is-the-difference-between-criminal-law-and-civil-law</a></li><li name="fdf4" id="fdf4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/fyi/what-is-kesavananda-bharati-case-vs-state-of-kerala-basic-structure-constitution-fundamental-rights-647544" data-href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/fyi/what-is-kesavananda-bharati-case-vs-state-of-kerala-basic-structure-constitution-fundamental-rights-647544" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">^https://www.indiatvnews.com/fyi/what-is-kesavananda-bharati-case-vs-state-of-kerala-basic-structure-constitution-fundamental-rights-647544</a></li><li name="0ca4" id="0ca4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">^<a href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/the-truth-about-animal-grief" data-href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/the-truth-about-animal-grief" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.bbcearth.com/news/the-truth-about-animal-grief</a></li><li name="7ec1" id="7ec1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">^<a href="https://www.legallyindia.com/lawschools/42-jobs-for-77-nlsiu-2014-grads-20140822-4988" data-href="https://www.legallyindia.com/lawschools/42-jobs-for-77-nlsiu-2014-grads-20140822-4988" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.legallyindia.com/lawschools/42-jobs-for-77-nlsiu-2014-grads-20140822-4988</a></li><li name="c40d" id="c40d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford#/media/File:Brasenose_College_Lodge_%28cropped%29.jpg" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford#/media/File:Brasenose_College_Lodge_(cropped).jpg" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasenose_College,_Oxford#/media/File:Brasenose_College_Lodge_(cropped).jpg</a></li></ol></div></div></section>
