He had dinner with his family and then went to sleep because he was exhausted after the long trip.</p><p name="f385" id="f385" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A little while later someone entered Srikanth’s room. Srikanth woke up with the sound of the door and asked “Who is there?”. Srikanth suspiciously took the brass flowerpot at the side of his bed and got up remembering what his fathers had told him on phone about the increasing thefts in the village. Alarmed, the thief ran out of the door trying to speak something. Srikanth started running after him with the heavy brass vase in his hand which his proud father had gifted him for graduating tenth after only his 3rd attempt. He still remembers how his father had praised him by saying, “I had cleared it in five attempts, you are very bright, very good”.</p><figure name="72ee" id="72ee" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*YTP5FE2mDMqu04n7dwY_Qw.gif" data-width="500" data-height="375" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YTP5FE2mDMqu04n7dwY_Qw.gif"></figure><p name="1123" id="1123" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The thief ran down the stairs and into the street and Srikanth followed screaming, “Thief, thief ……”. Srikanth swung the vase in his hand like a cannon ball right onto the back of the thief. The thief gave out a piercing cry and kept on running. Srikanth then took the pots from the potter shop and flung them at the thief. He felt proud at his brilliant aim thinking how supportive his father is letting him play the nationals in shot put. It felt it was raining pots in the village. When Srikanth ran out of them he turned to the shoes in the cobblers shop, the glasses and plates in the silverware shop, he didn’t even stop at flinging the bamboos supporting the shops. The entire village was getting destroyed by a hulk of a man skilled at flinging almost anything.</p><figure name="2952" id="2952" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gheP_RrnU-GUO_Xl8e_tRA.jpeg" data-width="360" data-height="239" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gheP_RrnU-GUO_Xl8e_tRA.jpeg"></figure><p name="12e0" id="12e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">All the villagers woke up with the sounds and started running behind the thief with their lathis along with Srikanth. The villagers were angry and frustrated because their sleep had been disturbed and their shops had been destroyed. Now I know what you might be thinking and you are correct this entire anger would be poured on the thief once he is caught. I think had the thief been aware he would be up against a team of angry villagers or worse a shot put athlete he would have never attempted such a feat (I would call it mission yampossible). The villagers soon caught up with the thief and trapped him in a gunny sack. This followed by intense kneading of the sack with sticks, stones, pots and plates (oh what lovely puris would have been made had there been flour and water in it instead of the thief). No stone was left unturned in making sure the content of the sack had four hundred and twelve bones (a full grown human has two hundred and six).</p><p name="bee1" id="bee1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the end when the human inside the sack, reduced to an eel, wriggled out of the bag, a lamp was brought near his face and to everyone’s shock it was none other than their beloved sarpanch. The same honest, modest and hardworking sarpanch who had boasted of the hand pump he had got installed in Madanlal’s field (who obviously had to bribe him and is his son-in-law) five years ago even in this years election.</p><p name="7e62" id="7e62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Srikanth dropped down dead on the floor at the sight of his beloved father but more so thinking about the amazing kick boxing that villagers will do to him and how the jujitsu champion (his mother) waiting at home will break his bones. And from then on Srikanth has always been locked up in a room when he is asleep because the village cannot risk another disaster. Though poor Lalbihari was also at fault had he spent the money given by the government in installing streetlights in the village and not the big LED television in his room he wouldn’t have seen such a day.</p></div></div></section>
