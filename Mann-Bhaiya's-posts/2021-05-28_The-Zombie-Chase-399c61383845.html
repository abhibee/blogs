He had sent a band of men into the jungles with instructions to obtain the treasure. It had taken him years of research to achieve this feat. He waited for hours but the team did not return. As he was sleeping in his tent he was woken up by an earthquake of such magnitude he had never experienced. His tent was demolished by the trees around and he escaped out of it fast to see a crevice in the earth so deep that he couldn’t see the end.</p><p name="4089" id="4089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly thousands of zombies began climbing out of it. At first he struggled to understand what just happened but then he quickly got into the ATV and drove as fast as he could. The zombies were following him. He drove through the forest as fast as he could. The zombies were gaining up. Everything that came in their way was getting destroyed. The zombies soon were gaining up with him. He saw Bandung city approaching but he started running out of gas he stepped on the pedal and rode as fast an ATV could drive. The houses started approaching he started screaming get out of the way. The people started running at the sight of the zombies but the zombies soon gained up on them and ate them.</p><p name="ed61" id="ed61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adam kept on driving without break until he reached a petrol pump, he got out of the ATV and opened the door of a nearby Toyota Corolla, he took the gun out his pocket. He showed it to the man inside and pushed him out, closed the door. The zombies had gained up a lot. Adam accelerated at full speed and drove on trying to leave the zombies behind. Unfortunately he encountered a dead end. He abandoned the car and climbed over the walls of the house beside him.</p><p name="b200" id="b200" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He went inside and asked the man where his car keys were. The man, confused, asked him who he was but at the sight of the gun he gave Adam his car and his phone in no time. Adam called Gerry and said, “get me airlifted right now from Margacinta Central Park”. Luckily the car was a civic type R. Adam thanked the house owner in his mind for buying a fast car. He drove through the door towards Margacinta.</p><p name="14b8" id="14b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">At the same time Husein Sastranegara International Airport Authority was called to ready an helicopter. In no time the helicopter was dispatched from Husein Sastranegara International Airport for Margacinta. Adam raced on till he reached Margacinta Central Park. The helicopterlanded in front of him he got out and jumped into the helicopter. The helicopter quickly took off and they reached Jakarta’s Soekarno – Hatta International Airport in no time. But the Zombies raced on the runway. They flew further on to Ngurah Rai International Airport but a rocket flew into their helicopter and the helicopter got destroyed and the helicopter fell killing Adam. The zombies vanished in no time after that.</p></div></div></section>
