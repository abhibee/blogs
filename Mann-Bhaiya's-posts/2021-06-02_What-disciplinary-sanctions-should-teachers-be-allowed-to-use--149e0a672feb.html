These disciplinary sanctions help teachers govern authority over true students. Gradually many of these disciplinary actions are being done away with because they negatively impact the child. I believe that teachers should not be rid of disciplinary sanctions completely. Without these disciplinary powers teachers are often left helpless in front of the multitude of students. Without disciplinary actions students to become unruly and disregarding. The pupils loose the respect for teachers if the teachers are not given powers to control them.</p><p name="284b" id="284b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Until few years ago corporal punishment was not unlawful in India. I have heard many stories from my elders that they used to be beaten by the teacher with a scale or a cane. The caning would cause a lot of pain but these punishments did not had a lasting physical effect. These practices were fruitful in teaching our parents manner and they had immense respect for their teacher. Many critics have argued that the corporal punishments is one of the best ways to keep a control over the students.</p><p name="0cdf" id="0cdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, in the modern world it is not the stick that works. The students are getting clever and the stick has proven ineffective. The modern children are more afraid of loosing marks or getting a bad review by teachers because these would effect their prospects of getting into colleges. The testing system in India might have not advanced in schools but the colleges are now keen in taking into account if the student is responsible, hard working and respectful toward his or her teachers or not. The teachers has the duty to mark the internal assessment and give an insight into the pupil’s overall performance therefore if the pupil forgets submit his homework or class work he or she is at fault and he will be marked and accessed accordingly.</p><p name="8406" id="8406" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The responsibility has shifted from the teacher’s shoulders to the student’s shoulders. Therefore it is up to the student now how he has to behave in front of teachers. Therefore corporal punishment is not a viable option in today’s times. Teachers still have the power of speech to make the student responsible for his own deeds. The earlier a student understands this the better because words like suspension and rustication in a students profile are two words that no college would like to hear.</p><p name="b6e5" id="b6e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rural areas are an exception to this fact but there the teachers still have the authority of beating children. The parents in those areas are not irked when their children are scolded or hit by his or her teacher.</p><p name="eacd" id="eacd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thus disciplinary sanctions are eventually becoming obsolete. The teachers have more than enough power already in their hand. It’s the future of the students that sits in the hands of these teachers. The students are at a loss If they don’t respect their teachers and the earlier the students understand this the better.</p></div></div></section><section name="a5e2" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3a16" id="3a16" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Picture Courtesy:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="591f" id="591f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p graf--trailing">^<a href="https://www.edsys.in/corporal-punishment-in-schools/" data-href="https://www.edsys.in/corporal-punishment-in-schools/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.edsys.in/corporal-punishment-in-schools/</a></li></ol></div></div></section>
