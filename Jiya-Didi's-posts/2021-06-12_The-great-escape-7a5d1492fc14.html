They had open spaces everywhere and one could see greenery stretching through long distances around the house. Navya, the only child of the house was a very attentive girl, everyone loved her. She and her dog, Neelu were inseparable. One night her parents had to leave immediately to the city as one of their relatives were ill. They told navya to stay in the house and that they will be back in the morning. Navya had lived alone before so she was not scared. She quickly bid goodbye to her parents and after closing the door Navya and Neelu went and started watching the television. After around an hour they went and ate dinner that was kept for them. Everything was normal and navya quickly went to bed after finishing her food. Neelu also went with her. It suddenly started raining outside so she quickly went and closed the window and went back to sleep. To her surprise Neelu started barking. He never used to bark before so she went and started petting him thinking that he might scared of the thunderstorm outside but Neelu was continuously barking, suddenly she smelt smoke and realised that the house was on fire because of a short circuit! With Neelu, she immediately ran outside. After safely getting outside she hugged Neelu and thanked him for informing her of what was happening or it would be a dreadful night. It was midnight, the house was on fire and no one was to be seen in vicinity, so she and Neelu went into the small shed which was at a distance from the house. Exhausted by what all she had just witnessed she closed her eyes to sleep. She was trying hard to not think of what would happen to her house by morning. She suddenly heard the the fireman’s siren and ran outside to see what was happening. The fireman put out the fire in no time and Navya could finally breath a sigh of relief and asked how did they come to know about the fire. They said that the police had come this way as sometimes during rain some trees fall and when they saw the house on fire they called the firemen. Navya thanked them profusely and that night she stayed in the small shed. Next day, when her parent got home she told them about her great escape and the concerned parents never left her alone at house ever again.</p></div></div></section>
