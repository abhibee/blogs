Though only being 5 years old he considered himself big. One day Aman and his parents were going to Chandigarh to meet his grandparents. Aman was very excited as it was his first time on a train. Aman and his parents reached the station to catch their early morning train. The platform was only partially crowded as it was a working day. Aman and his parents were settling on a bench, waiting for their train to arrive. Aman’s father asked whether he would like to see the whole platform. Aman readily agreed and they started walking. They walked for a while when Aman asked his father for a packet of chips, his father agreed and told him to stay right behind him. Aman agreed. While his father was buying chips Aman saw a glittery thing on the railway track he thought that if he would give it to his father, he would be very happy so he went and climbed down to railway tracks. He picked it up but suddenly the train’s whistle blew. Aman didn’t know what to do so he stood there dumb struck. The train would almost hit him but thankfully a 12-year-old boy noticed him and jumped on tracks and pushed himself and Aman off the tracks on time. The train also came to a sudden halt. Alarmed by the ruckus Aman’s father realized what had happened, he rushed towards Aman, who was in shock. He first hugged him and then scolded him for not listening. He repeatedly praised the boy for his bravery and thanked and awarded him for the selfless act.</p></div></div></section>
