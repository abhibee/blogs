It was sports day, and apart from the normal races we had a spoon and potato race. We all were excited as that was the new type of race for us. We all lined up on the starting line. The whistle blew and we started running while balancing the potato on the spoon. We had to be fast and also our motive was not to drop potato as then we would be disqualified. During the race I was fully focused and I did not care about how others are doing and was just concentrating on not letting the potato fall.</p><p name="17d4" id="17d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could hear the audience cheering and laughing loudly. I did not pay attention to that too. I just thought they are applauding for us. But after the race ended, it was then when I got to know what all happened behind my back. And after I got to know I couldn’t stop laughing. There were 8 competitors including me. The whistle blew and everyone started. One of the girls had barely taken 5 steps when her potato fell and she screamed in disbelief. Surprised by her shriek the girl beside turned her head really fast to see what happened to her. This led her potato to fly and hit another girl on her face and she also dropped therefore. So now three people were already down. They all started scrambling and after a while picked there potatoes and started again. Disturbed by the nuisance the fourth girl tripped and fell and her potato which went on to the fifth girl’s lane . She without notice stamped on it, slipped and fell. Only three girls were left by then including me and slowly and steadily we completed the race. I was unaware of what was happening behind me. The three of us were awarded gold silver bronze without any challenge. But the day I remember only for the hilarious scene just out of some funny movie which I might have missed watching but can feel it as I was there when all of this happened.</p><p name="5523" id="5523" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sometimes it surprises me how small things can bring so much joy to anyone, but as its said happiness is a state of mind.</p></div></div></section>
