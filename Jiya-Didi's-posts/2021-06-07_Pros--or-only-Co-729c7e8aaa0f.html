During lockdown all of us were hoping that the lockdown ends soon and we get free from the scare of getting the coronavirus, during this time we are trying to utilize our time at home productively. I also consolidated at one place what all I have done during the lockdown and felt good about it.</p><figure name="f2fd" id="f2fd" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*G8qEj6HO8_yS_aMm.png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*G8qEj6HO8_yS_aMm.png"></figure><p name="be75" id="be75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I was feeling a little low because of the lockdown but while doing this project I tried to find out the positive side of the lockdown and thus my perspective also changed.</p><figure name="9e5f" id="9e5f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*zZ7jThdIhieGp0yU" data-width="450" data-height="450" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zZ7jThdIhieGp0yU"></figure><p name="abd6" id="abd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">I found out that it was not that bad as I was thinking, as it had some positive side to it too. Every coin has two sides and we must not only see one side of the coin but also the other side. This is how this project helped me to change my perspective of seeing things. Doing this, also helped me to use my time productively. I might have wasted my time, but instead this helped me in learning something new and it also opened my mind. Time and again it is said that whenever we do something new we learn and grow as a person. So, we should never stop trying new stuff and always think positive.</p></div></div></section>
