There is nothing that nature has not given us. But in return, we have done nothing but destroy it. According to ecosystem everything on the earth is interlinked everyone depends on each other but, humans, are taking all the privileges and not fulfilling their duty towards nature. Humans are considered the smartest animals on earth but it doesn’t feel like it, because even animals help save the ecosystem in their ways. We have heard many stories about animals showing compassion towards nature but humans, they are so selfish and stubborn that instead of helping restore nature to its previous glory they are busy destroying it. Last year, an incident happened which caused many people to realise how cruel humans can be. A pregnant and hungry elephant died because she ate a pineapple, filled with explosives! This is outrageous! Killing innocent and suspecting animals doesn’t show power but, it does show stupidity. This is one of the many stories of death of poor animals due to some selfish human being. Many a times people get away with it because of being famous or due to bribery. Each country should have strict rules on these crimes so that no man even thinks of showing cruelty towards helpless living things. Not only do humans show cruelty towards animals, but also plants, many people just to take a pretty picture amid flowers, squash and destroy flower beds. There are many selfish people in this world, but there is always a way to protect nature earth by taking small steps like feeding street dogs, planting trees. These small acts of kindness can make a huge impact. So, today on the occasion of world environment day, I pledge I will do everything in my power to help save mother nature and everyone else be it a human, animal or plant in any way possible.</p><figure name="ad82" id="ad82" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*jtVL33oRTYmmwzDC.jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jtVL33oRTYmmwzDC.jpg"></figure></div></div></section>
