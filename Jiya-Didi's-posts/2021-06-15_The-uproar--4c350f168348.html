While discussing our teacher mentioned how it is affecting eyesight. Yes! this was the point one of the students was looking for. He jumped on the opportunity and said “Yes maam! But all the parents don’t say a word when our classes are going on, but as soon as we open some other app like if we want to watch a video after a long time, all the parents suddenly get active and start lecturing us on how much it would hurt eyes!” this was the spark everyone needed. Suddenly an uproar of agreement came and everyone started agreeing and started complaining about how, studying for 6 hours straight wont hurt our eyes but a 10 minute video will make us blind. The teacher tried to change the topic, but it was now grasped by the students. One by one everyone told their incidents and everything came back to the same thing, 6 hours of staring at the screen won’t affect our eyes but a video would. Everyone was out of control! Some people were shouting while others were nodding in agreement. It looked as if they were just looking for an outlet to let all there agony out as everyone was stuck at home and at last they had found one. After a long discussion our teacher finally stepped in again and made everyone settle down. Everyone settled down quickly and by their face you could tell that they all had been waiting to do this since long.</p><figure name="38e0" id="38e0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*3gk-Jyo9ta4dz-Q2qSvC2A.png" data-width="233" data-height="255" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3gk-Jyo9ta4dz-Q2qSvC2A.png"></figure></div></div></section>
