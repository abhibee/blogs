It was a Saturday morning; I went to the balcony and saw there were 2 children learning karate. At that moment I felt a strong attraction towards it, and from the next day, I started. I used to practice every day for 3–4 months when my first belt exam took place. After a week my result came, I had passed! I had officially become a yellow belt! I continued practicing but then we had to shift to Kolkata as my father got transferred.</p><p name="0b9d" id="0b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was Kolkata where I got to know this art fully. The complex we used to live used have karate classes three times a week. On my first day I got to know that I have to start from beginning, ie; from white belt as there was a change the form of karate. But this didn’t stop me and I again started from scratch. The training I used to do here was completely different and harder than what I had done before. I learnt that discipline is one of the most important things to learn it. After a few months my first belt exam took place in this form. The teachers liked my performance and gave me a double promotion! I Had skipped yellow belt and had directly reached green belt! I was selected to participate in a tournament. This was the first time I ever went to a tournament. My sir thought I was ready for districts tournaments which was in 2 weeks. I used to practice every day and then on the day of the tournament I felt nervous, but ready. The tournament began and after everyone finished there kata it was my chance. when I started I was going really strong and I kept everything in mind but then got the last step wrong. This small mistake cost me a gold I had lost any hope of winning and I told my mother that there is no point waiting and we should leave for home but she told me to wait till the results are announced. I reluctantly went and sat with the participants. All the judges were talking indistinctively among themselves they were taking a lot of time. We knew there was something wrong, suddenly one of the judges called me and said, “sukriti, we all know that you did the last step wrong but if we ignore that, it was the best kata we had ever seen, your teacher told me this was your first tournament so maybe it was because of nervousness. We all would like to give you gold but we cannot ignore that you did it wrong so we will give you bronze this time.” As soon as I heard it my happiness knew no bounds I never thought that I would win! I just needed to be more confident and less nervous. From here started a series of participation in tournaments. The next tournament was the state, this time I practiced even harder, I would always stay concentrated and disciplined, everything was going perfect just when I got hurt really bad on my left leg. We had to rush to the hospital, my leg was continuously bleeding and a little part of my bone was visible. The doctor assured me everything would be fine and said that they will have to put stiches to close the wound so that it heals faster. I was horrified of needles but I agreed. I got stiches in layers, 2 beneath and 3 above. It didn’t pain a lot at that time, but it sure did look painful. The doctor said that I have to have a bandage around my leg for 2 and a half weeks and get it change every 2 days. I was very miserable as my doctor didn’t allow me to take part in the tournament which was 3 weeks later. After my wound healed, I again started practicing and this time my focus was only on the nationals, between this I even had my belt exam and I again had a double promotion I was already a purple belt! I would practice every day for weeks and when the day of the tournament came, I knew nothing could stop me from achieving my goal. The first event was kata. I gave my heart and soul into it and my hard work paid of, I had won a gold in the nationals! I was very happy but it was not the time to get distracted as one event was still left. The next event was kumite, or fight I had put all my anger into it after each tiring fight I felt stronger. At the end I won a silver in kumite. This tournament really boosted my confidence. I knew that winning a gold and a silver was only a start. After 2 weeks there was another tournament, this was the districts, I was again focused in practicing, the tournament neared but sadly, I got food poisoning. Everyone told me that its ok if I didn’t go, but I was determined even though being ill, it didn’t stop me to secure a bronze medal. I remember, that after we reached home I even puked. Everything was going well, when we again had to shift, after big farewell from my friends I was back in Gurgaon. After reaching Gurgaon I joined a karate class in which the sir was really different, I used to learn from a very strict and disciplined and this sir was exactly the opposite. At first I used to feel weird, but as time passed I understood his way of teaching, he makes us do exercise in a way which keeps are minds distracted and we wouldn’t even realize that we just did something really hard. He would make us do really weird things and once were even crawling under cars! I never realized but if I think, all these really helped me build my confidence and strength again. We would even have a small party after tournaments or if it was someone’s birthday! After a few months of practice, I was again ready to go to a tournament, the first tournament I went after shifting, it was a district one, I won a bronze in it. After this I had my belt exam in which I became a brown belt! Everything was going perfect, when the corona virus came to India, everything was shut, but even during the pandemic my sir was determined he would work so hard and take online classes for us, at first when online classes started it was very hard as concentrating on a screen is really difficult but, after a while, everyone got used to it as we have to adapt according to situations and be strong forever and after this pandemic, I will again do my best and make every person who supported me proud.</p><figure name="6aa2" id="6aa2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*RB7He3RxDtIxO5LRz_YyOQ.png" data-width="270" data-height="287" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RB7He3RxDtIxO5LRz_YyOQ.png"></figure><p name="2fc7" id="2fc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">While writing this blog, I realized how karate affected my life and I will be forever grateful to all my teachers who motivated me through every step and especially my parents who urged me to never stop even during difficult times.</p></div></div></section>
