I wake up early in the morning and wake up everyone, but sometimes I let my sister sleep a little late as I like her a lot. I first try to wake them up nicely but then I have to scratch their feet for them to wake up. After my mom wakes up, we go downstairs and walk. There is a naughty bird downstairs which I have named ‘choosy’ I was once going to catch him but then my mom stopped me. After taking two big round I pull my mom to go back because she gets tired (I don’t get tired, she does. wink wink). After returning home I eat my food till then my brother wakes up and then he pets me. Usually both my brother and sister Wake up early and go somewhere and then return after hours that seems like days but nowadays, they stay at home with me because they know how much I miss them. After an hour when I think my sister has slept enough, I go and lick her feet and she get so happy and cuddles me. I love when she wakes up because then we play a lot we run around and she gives me treats. I have a huge responsibility as throughout the day I have to go to everyone so that they pet me. Sometimes they throw the ball away and I fetch them thinking they did it by mistake but after 20–30 times of running to and fro I take my ball away and bite it. I also have a huge responsibility of not letting those dirty pigeons come to my balcony. And after every time I make them go away, I show my father and he praise me a lot. In the evening my sister goes down to play and when she comes back, I smell her shoes to see whether she met some other dog without me and if she does, I get angry. As soon as she enters the house, I come with my leash so that she can take me downstairs. I love when I go downstairs with my sister, we have so much fun, we run around we play with a ball, we chase squirrels and cats and we also meet other dogs. I don’t like when my sister pets any other dog unless he/she is my friend. I pull her away. After a long day of having too many treats and fun. I eat my food and go to sleep to wake up fresh for the next day.</p></div></div></section>
