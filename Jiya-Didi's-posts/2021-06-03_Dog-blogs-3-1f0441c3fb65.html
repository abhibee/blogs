I started barking to my sister so that she would get away from it but instead she started bringing it towards me! I panicked and started running and to my surprise my sister was still laughing. After a while she finally put the skateboard down and came to me I jumped on to her lap as I was scared and she started laughing even harder. I didn’t mind as my tail was safe because my tail is scared from all the things with tires. But to my horror she started going towards the skateboard, with me! I tried to scramble out of her arms but she was holding firmly she finally came and put me on the skateboard I froze. Suddenly I started moving again but I was not even moving a single muscle! I realized that the skateboard was moving!!! I couldn’t believe my eyes!! It was so much fun I don’t know why I never tried this before! It was all going well, when I got the courage to move. As soon as i moved a little the skateboard made a loud noise and I jumped hard which lead the skateboard to go towards the other side while I landed directly on my sister lap. I never ever went close to the skateboard ever again and my sister also gave up trying to remove my fear of skateboards.</p><figure name="66df" id="66df" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*BSa-w43RtOpUzV5v.jpg" data-width="1199" data-height="675" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BSa-w43RtOpUzV5v.jpg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The devil</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
