We were walking when I noticed a pink dragonfly. We had never seen anything like it before. Usually, the dragonflies we saw were reddish-brown, but this dragonfly had a bight pink sort of color. My friends didn’t find anything special but a few weeks ago I had read on article about dragon flies. I immediately recognized it. I told my friend to run and call the teacher thankfully, the dragon didn’t fly away I showed it to her and my teacher was also very impressed she said that I have a keen and alert eye towards nature. She clicked a picture of the dragon fly and it got published in the school magazine as well. We later got to know the exact name. It was called Crimson Marsh Glider though it is not that rare, it is hard to find as it does not usually come to the urban area and camouflages in forests. It is really fascinating to see these insects and wonder how many beautiful colors they are found in.</p><figure name="d7b0" id="d7b0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uzqDdv75Uu717AFp84QwdA.png" data-width="275" data-height="183" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uzqDdv75Uu717AFp84QwdA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Crimson marsh glider</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
