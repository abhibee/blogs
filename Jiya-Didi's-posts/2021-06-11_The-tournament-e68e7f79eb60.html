Sanvi had been practicing for months and the ‘big day’ was finally here. She woke up fresh and energetic but there was still a part of her which was nervous. Sanvi was excited and was ready to go an hour before the tournament started.</p><p name="b5e6" id="b5e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They were in the car in no time and started for venue; but, little did she know, what was awaited. Everything was normal for the fifteen minutes but then the car suddenly stopped. Her father tried to start the car again but it did not budge. After trying for twenty minutes they tried to call a cab but nothing was available as it was early in the morning. Sanvi started to panic but her father calmed her down and started thinking.</p><p name="b34b" id="b34b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meanwhile at school the tournament was about to start in five minutes. The participants had to reports thirty minutes prior to that. Sanvi’s bestfriend, aliya, noticed the fact that Sanvi was not there on time. She knew how much this meant to Sanvi so she immediately went to the teacher and explained her worry regarding the situation. She convinced the teacher to change the schedule and let the dances to happen first. As soon as the last dance ended, Sanvi came in. Sanvi thought that she missed her part and was all gloomy until aliya shouted and came and hugged her. She said that Sanvi did not miss her turn and was right on time. Sanvi swiftly went to the stage and took her place.</p><p name="5dd2" id="5dd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">After the tournament finished, aliya told her everything she did for Sanvi and then she realized that only time tests the loyalty and worth of a friend and also that having a true friend is a blessing.</p></div></div></section>
