            <p name="72a5" id="72a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The ride back home was dark. The spaced street
              lights with a cap like holder had mostly fused with one out of ten still glowing dimly. Being a cloudy
              night did not help either. Adi was returning home with his friend Pratyush from their tutor’s home after
              dusk. Adi was quite comfortable with the subject but the prospect of meeting friends there made him still
              go. And his teacher Mr Neeladri was a thorough gentleman. He did not miss the mid tuition tea and samosa
              snack for his students and that made the deal impossible to miss.</p>

            <p name="ebb4" id="ebb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">That day, the class had extended beyond the
              stipulated 1 hour. Sun had gone down. The prospect of riding the bicycle home using the main road for 40
              mins vs taking the jungle shortcut, which would be just 20 mins seemed too lengthy. They decided to go
              with the shortcut. Sun had gone down but the light was still there and they knew they would make it.</p>
            <figure name="63e0" id="63e0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image"
                data-image-id="1*4oo9ESZuq--Q-PlL86eHEA.jpeg" data-width="174" data-height="290"

            <p name="e29d" id="e29d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Had it not been for the cycle chain to come
              out, they would have probably made it. However 5 mins into the ride, Adi felt his pedals freely rotating.
              They stopped and tried all the mechanics they could try and finally were able to fix the chain back. They
              knew they could not ride fast anymore. Darkness had taken over by then. Confidence was going down. It had
              rained throughout the day. The rain gods are not forgiving during the monsoon in this part of the world.
              Adi was unsure if he liked rains a lot or hated it more. The dim street lights were the only reference
              they had and they were not sure if they wanted to go back or go forward. They were unaware of how far they
              had come. Gathering all the courage they had they kept moving. None uttered a word.</p>
            <figure name="f9c7" id="f9c7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image"
                data-image-id="1*WeIOhScyK10zTdG2pGeXQg.png" data-width="896" data-height="826" data-is-featured="true"
                src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WeIOhScyK10zTdG2pGeXQg.png"></figure>
            <p name="ab64" id="ab64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Suddenly they heard a loud thud in front of
              them and both pressed brakes in unison out of reflex. To their dismay, part of the street had collapsed
              into the stream flowing next to the narrow street and they could hear flowing water very near them yet not
              sure how near.</p>
            <p name="9024" id="9024" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pratyush made the first sound. “I can still see
              that a part of the road is not broken. Let’s walk around from there ..” his volume lowering towards the
              end of the sentence as if asking. Adi, without any second thoughts, started walking around, lifting his
              cycle. The dark night and the weather was inspiring the crickets and toads to compete for noise they were
              making.. Both the boys also heard hustling of bushes on the sides of the road but did not dare to
              acknowledge, pretending as if nothing was there and continued cycling.</p>
            <figure name="65e7" id="65e7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image"

            <p name="62da" id="62da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It was looking to be an endless ride.. Last
              week the same ride was much faster. With full attention on the sounds and the feeble light,, they kept
              riding. Until.. something beneath the tree on the right moved. Both instinctively stopped again, trying to
              understand the nature of the threat. Then they heard it feebly — “What’s the time?” . They looked more
              intently. The old lady sitting under the tree lifted her face and looked at them with glowing eyes and
              asked them again — “What’s the time?”. Her tooth was jagged and mostly broken. That was it.. Adi and
              Pratyush could not hold anymore. They cried to the top of their lungs — “Bhaag!!!” and irrespective of
              what they could see or not and how bumpy the ride would have been or the chain status, they rode the
              fastest in their lives ever. After five minutes of riding, they could see the end of the forest and the
              main road. Their speed did not reduce till they reached homes.</p>
            <p name="90c6" id="90c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">They did not go for tuition for
              the next 2 days and never tried the shortcut again. Both grew up and still sometimes recall that day they
              took the shortcut and they only know what happened.</p>
