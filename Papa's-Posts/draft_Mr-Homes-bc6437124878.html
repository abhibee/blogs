It was relatively cold for an October evening 1878. His wollen english suit and hat were keeping him warm but he took a mental note to get his leather gloves the next time. The journey back home was about 3 hours. There were not many passengers waiting when the train came to screeching halt at the station. Dr Brook embarked and found his reserved seat next to the window. </p><p name="5bff" id="5bff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The dim lights inside the train hindered his plan to read his newspaper on the way back. </p></div></div></section>
