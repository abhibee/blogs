The office work and timings has been quite stressful over the last few weeks. Though I have been thinking that I will start some form of exercise ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô for about 5 weeks now, as well known, tomorrow was elusive. Before lockdown was imposed, it was much better. I and the kids atleast went down early morning and did some running, cycling, walking, or badminton. When I heard about the announcement of this course, I decided to join to get myself going and promptly paid the 2k INR fees well in advance. They say that in human mind, the fear of a loss is a more powerful motivator than a prospect of a gain. I was about to verify this postulate.</p><p name="ee89" id="ee89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But after paying the money I forgot all about it and got to my regular ways. The course was supposed to be from 7‚Äì9 AM. Completely forgetting about the workshop, I scheduled another call at 8 AM daily with my US team and the alarm for that was my wake up call every morning.</p><p name="f379" id="f379" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, the night before the course was to start, the instructors(2 of them) setup a WhatsApp group and send instructions of dos and donts for the class and the zoom link etc. I recalled‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähaan I have heard about it and suddenly the 2000 Rs UPI payment came to my mind. I stiffened up and rescheduled the meeting the next day 2 hours early, that is at 6 AM. Announced that the next call( Friday) will be cancelled and the other two days were Saturday and Sunday.</p><p name="d172" id="d172" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Day-1‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThursday</p><p name="ab27" id="ab27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I woke up at 5.30 AM and had a nice solo tea in the balcony, hearing the birds chirp and East sky getting red in anticipation of Sun to show up. I had seen this after long. Was feeling nice. Between 6 and 7, I finished the call, responded to a few emails and chalked the plan for the day. That was actually fast.</p><p name="772f" id="772f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sharp at 7, I was ready on my mat in front of my MacBook in a nice yoga attire and more importantly a nice yoga-studio zoom background üòâ. You know this would give me some upper hand with some nice first impression(though it was not a competition)¬†.</p><p name="49a0" id="49a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were 16 other participants and two instructors. Everyone introduced themselves and were to end their introductions with the words ‚ÄúI belong to you‚Äù. The two female instructors‚Ää‚Äî one from bangalore and one from Pune were in their early 30s and certified yoga instructors. The participants were a mix with a median age of 40 and spread of 25‚Äì70. One aunty made it clear that the instructions should be in Hindi only but the instructors said that they would try their best since only one of them knew Hindi. Everyone was asked to share their reason to join the course. Many seemed to have attended the workshop earlier and had nice reasons and goals to attend. When it came to me I almost uttered the 2000 Rs but gathered myself quickly and said something about being a more spiritual being with health and muscles and kindness.. they looked confused and promptly moved to the next person. I was too. But I continued.</p><p name="6e10" id="6e10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They started with some warmup yoga and jumping jacks, which I painfully did. With the background effect on, I could see some parts of my body disappearing and reappearing in the zoom screen and started trying different angles to see the affects on the screen. But suddenly noticed that two instructors weren‚Äôt amused and were making faces while a couple of other participants stopped and finding my jumping jacks interesting. The instructors ‚Äúrespectfully‚Äù asked me to look at what they were doing and do the same.. I was trying. Anyways that ended soon and we sat on the mat. Shortly after we were instructed to sit on the mat in ‚Äúvajrasan‚Äù pose since it keeps your spine straight and the breathing pranayams were about to start.</p><figure name="e91c" id="e91c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*IirgBnkB5vsA_Ea6KFGREQ.jpeg" data-width="1500" data-height="1263" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IirgBnkB5vsA_Ea6KFGREQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="da46" id="da46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Vajrasan‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI must say, some people are not built for vajrasan. I had not been able to establish the best of the rapport so far with the instructors or participants and this was not going to go well I knew. That fat aunty and the bald 65 year uncle had no trouble getting into the vajrasan pose and sprung into the pose in a snap.. everyone was waiting for me. I pulled both my legs beneath my bottom one by one as if trying to pull and tie Parsuram‚Äôs bow with all my might, arranged the toes to flatten up and held myself as straight as possible sitting on my heals. Such a painful pose.. what‚Äôs the use. I knew I was stuck there. However the instructions started. My face was saying it all I am sure. The instructor checked‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äù Mr Sharma‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall ok?‚Äù. My breath was already feeling stuck. I did not answer but showed a thumbs up rather and balanced myself back. I am sure a few participants had pinned my screen along with the instructor‚Äôs, anticipating more fun to come. I did not disappoint them. Somehow I endured the 20 min breathing session. But then they said you can unfold your legs and relax. Unfold.. I was not even feeling them now. I had to do something special to unfold. I fell down on one side and used my hands to unlock each of my legs, knees, toes, ankles and kept them midair for a while to help the blood flow and senses to return. The process took 4‚Äì5 mins. I had not bothered about the laptop so far.. and what views that was making on the zoom screen of others. But not hearing anything for some time, when I looked back at the laptop, all eyes were intently watching me aghast, with most mouths open. The instructors had also forgot about the course for a few mins. I tried to normalize the situation¬†.. opened my mic and said in a matter of factly manner‚Äî ‚Äúare we waiting for something?‚Äù. The faces of the meditation instructors went a bit red as if they needed meditation now. They somehow collected themselves and said.. ‚ÄúSir, we are waiting for ‚Äúall‚Äù to be ready for the next step.‚Äù. I just could pull an awkward smile but some of the participants seemed laughing with mics off. I didn‚Äôt bother. One of the instructors said, ‚Äúsir u can do all breathing and kriya in ‚ÄúSukhasan‚Äù only from here on and rest can do Vajrasan‚Äù. Relief.</p><p name="e2a7" id="e2a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were gyan sessions after that. Body and mind cleansing ideas. Etc. Om chanting. More gyan sessions and breathing rhythms and ultimately we were let go off.</p><p name="61b0" id="61b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overall it was not bad. We were given some homework too.</p><p name="b5e9" id="b5e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next three days went similar with increasing number of repetitions and rigor. They did not forget to ask me every time if I did my homework and I never said no.</p><p name="390e" id="390e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of the four day course however I feel good about doing it snd will continue some of the techniques learnt, in the morning until I get a chance to go downstairs regularly. But definitely I won‚Äôt do it in Vajrasan.</p><p name="73f3" id="73f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PS‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthese are 5 good knowledge nuggets(sutras) knowing which in some ways can solve all problems</p><ol class="postList"><li name="c5a4" id="c5a4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Opposite values are complimentary to each other and define each other.</li><li name="408c" id="408c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Accept situations and people as they are.</li><li name="10e4" id="10e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don‚Äôt become the football of others‚Äô opinions.</li><li name="af98" id="af98" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Don‚Äôt see intentions behind others‚Äô mistakes.</li><li name="2de0" id="2de0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Stay in the present moment.
