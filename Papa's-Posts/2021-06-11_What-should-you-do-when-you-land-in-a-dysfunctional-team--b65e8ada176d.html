Simply check these facts —</p><ol class="postList"><li name="44e1" id="44e1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Does work complete week by week as per the plan?</li><li name="8aed" id="8aed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is there difficulty in understanding what others are working on, including your boss?</li><li name="3a54" id="3a54" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do deadlines keep moving and everyone is ok with that?</li><li name="2d54" id="2d54" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do people share their weeknesses and strengths freely and willing to talk on improvements.</li><li name="2752" id="2752" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is success celebrated regularly uninhibited and everyone truely feels great about it?</li><li name="0acc" id="0acc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is bad performance addressed without delay even if it means letting go of people(citing clear reasons and enough corrective oppertunity and respectfully) .</li><li name="2193" id="2193" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Is personal and group(team) accountability respected and is accountability the language between cross cultural/geographic teams?</li><li name="e539" id="e539" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Do people help each other and respect each other? Do people appreciate others behind their backs?</li></ol><p name="bd0a" id="bd0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What can you do to fix these:-</strong><br>Each of the problems need to be addressed one at a time. Very clearly, you do not need to be the boss to fix things and live a more enriching work-life .. Afterall its your life with limited time -</p><ol class="postList"><li name="f528" id="f528" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Start with clearly, fearlessly and openly acknowledging in public(team) your own strengths and weekness and what would be a complimentary strength/weakness.</li><li name="1312" id="1312" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Clearly acknowledge the ongoing projects, their purpose, milestones and timeline as per your understanding and ask to be corrected.</li><li name="abdd" id="abdd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Clearly acknowledge that things are not moving and what symptoms make you think so.</li><li name="1d5c" id="1d5c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Separate people from behaviours and call out all the good behaviours that you have observed so far. Call out all the strengths that you have observed in people so far. The affect of this will be that others will start opening up naturally. Once it warms up, call out that we need to speak about weaknesses comfortably in the same way and work on them together.</li><li name="7334" id="7334" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Call out some interesting facts at suitable points —<strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">( Fact )</strong> Like in life, you don’t have to be generic and care for the entire world. You just need to work well with and care for the people around you and enjoy that. Like you don’t compete with your family memebers, your aim is to compete with the world out there and do it together. <br>Work is a large part of life and cannot/should not be separated.</li><li name="3ab9" id="3ab9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Start the concept of unit accomplishment(s)/day and unit accountability, celebrating every success, and constantly move to a higher level(go for bigger accomplishments). Eg. on day one, everyone accountably commits to a very small accomplishment and keeps the promise. That is celebrated the next day. Again repeat the same next day.. this time a littlle more challanging commitment until an equilibrium is reached. Find another more chalanging commitment soon after.</li><li name="22ba" id="22ba" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">( Fact )</strong>Accountability is the core to team’s culture and has all the power in the world. If you take accountability upfront and passionately, you will become unstoppable. Its <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">your</strong> success or <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">your</strong> failure. The power transfers to <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">you</strong>. Acknowledging failure and learning from it is growth. Faster you take accountability, fail and learn, faster you grow in life, in work. The cycle has to be fast, fearless and passionate. And no-one goes anywhere meaningful, alone. When everyone takes accountability of their stuff, celebrate each others’ and collective success, life becomes literally boundless and abundant, in all respects.</li><li name="81d7" id="81d7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Insist that the team should meet daily and foster the above behaviours every day.</li><li name="8881" id="8881" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Acknowledge your strengths, weaknesses, learnings, accomplishments, desires, needs, inhbitions, goals, etc. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">again and again</strong>. <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Receive and give.</strong></li><li name="9e07" id="9e07" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">There will be disagreements, slips and periods of depleting hope. Its all about building a culture of recovering and reseting accountability, putting efforts to move up the slope until <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">a culture of collective-momentum is established</strong>. And then the reaps of the efforts will start showing in such fruitful and gratifying ways, that is hard to imagine in the beginging and are the miracles of human ingenuinity.</li></ol></div></div></section>
