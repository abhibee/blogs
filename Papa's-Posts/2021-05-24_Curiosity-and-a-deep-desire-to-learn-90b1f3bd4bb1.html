Let me step back a bit. ‚ÄúTopic‚Äù is a large thing. Learning always happens in small nuggets. The quest to answer a small question that pops up in the head is unit learning. When such units starts accumulating that‚Äôs where you discover new curious questions and the cycle builds on itself. But the fact remains‚Ää‚Äî learning always happens in small unit nuggets.</p><p name="46f3" id="46f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So to learn anything you desire, ask bit size questions first that come to your mind.. not any one else‚Äôs suggestion. The crux is your desire to know and it‚Äôs your win path. And keep finding answers for them, through books, articles, videos, blogs, in person, experiments, polls etc wherever. This will stick and will be of high quality. Our brain üß† functions like that.. we need to learn not to come in the way.</p><p name="bff3" id="bff3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It may sound weird but let‚Äôs say I want to learn about medicine(a topic that I am not trained in). Obviously to be a doctor and be able to treat people you need a degree and formal training.. but if I desire to learn medicine and out of curiosity gather knowledge and understanding of how body functions, Anatomy of various systems, body parts, affects of extraneous substances etc, my journey to become a doctor will smoothen up and the degree will be a matter of formality. Learning would be fun. And this process would be fueled by byte size compounding of knowledge. (More on compounding later)</p><p name="451e" id="451e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another example‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI want to learn to make cakes. The natural basic string of questions would be, what equipment you need, what ingredients you need, what recipes are needed for the type I want to try, how long it takes, when can I try etc. etc. Keep answering these and keep moving forward.</p><p name="4ce0" id="4ce0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Happy learning. ü•Ç.</p></div></div></section>
