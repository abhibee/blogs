Every time in every class I landed with the same roll number by default. Why that matters? It does.. I was the first and experimental candidate for all tests, activities, vivas, recitations, etc etc. In my engineering college, I was the first one to be called for any verbal exam and everyone else intently watched me on what not to do when their turn comes.</p><p name="97a5" id="97a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However there were certain advantages too. For example, I was the first one to be relieved out of such exams as well.</p><p name="2e00" id="2e00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One incident is remarkable where roll no 1 really helped me. My father’s job had transferred to Kolkata from Delhi and we had just moved to Kolkata. I joined a new school in class 5 and was settling down. At that age making new friends is fairly easy and I was settling down quite well. Except that there was a third new language to learn, that I had no idea about — Bengali. All other students were studying Bengali for last two years and were quite well versed. It was “kala akshar bhains barabar “ for me. I scored 3 out of 40 in my first monthly class test and that too because of catching some marginal similarities between Hindi and Bengali lipi, especially numerals. My teacher, Mr Ganguli, showed immense patience and said he would give me extra guidance in coming up to speed(which never happened). He doubled as my sports teacher and there was some impact of Bengali class impression on the field too and I had to try everything extra hard.</p><p name="3d41" id="3d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However with a lot of futile effort, and testing his patience every month’s class test, I reached the final exam, which was a reading assignment from the textbook, in front of the class. Well, I still remember the 5 min speech he had given after he heard me read Bengali so so fluently about the hard work I had done to reach here👏🏻👏🏻. Everyone in the class was more than surprised to see the miracle unfold in front of their eyes.</p><figure name="496a" id="496a" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*yqtJqvRFiyBVxgKZPJgybg.gif" data-width="2048" data-height="2048" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*yqtJqvRFiyBVxgKZPJgybg.gif"></figure><p name="5f7c" id="5f7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Well the trick was simple. The reading was from a particular story, each student reading a paragraph, in sequence of his/her “roll number”.. I went on reading “Hitopdesher Kautha” fluently — ”Godabori nodeer teere ekta prokando shrumul gaach aache..” and so on.. Well see.. I still remember the entire paragraph “by heart” every single full stop and comma! I had written it in English the day before anticipating it and memorized it. I just recited from memory, holding the Bengali book(most likely upside down)😆. When Ganguliji asked roll number 1 to come in the front of the class to read, I skipped a heartbeat and some of my classmates started listening more intently in anticipation of a lot of fun coming.. but as soon as he said — read the first paragraph I knew history was in the making. Actually either ways history would have been made. I would have failed colossally if it had been any other paragraph, even paragraph #2😆 .. or if I did not have roll number 1!! Who knows, if someone was absent in between, all calculations would have gone haywire. But I read it so fluently that after I finished there was a silence in the class for 2 mins and then Ganguliji started with wiping his tears asking for a round of applause for me! 😉😉🙏🏻</p></div></div></section>
